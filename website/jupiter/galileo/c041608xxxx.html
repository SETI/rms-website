**Caption:**

This image is a mosaic of four Galileo images from the C10 encounter,
C0416088922, C0416088968, C0416089022, and C04160890645. It provides an edge-
on view of the gossamer ring at a [phase angle](/glossary.html#phase_angle) of
179 degrees. This high [phase angle](/glossary.html#phase_angle) emphasizes
very fine dust. The image has been enhanced logarithmically in order to reveal
the faintest structures. The full dynamic range is a factor of 1000, with each
step in color (blue to red, red to yellow, and yellow to black and white)
indicating roughly a ten-fold increase in brightness. The image has also been
stretched vertically by a factor of two to better reveal the vertical
structure of the Jovian ring system.

The main ring and halo are seen at left in black and white. Shown in yellow is
the Amalthea ring, named because it is precisely bounded by the orbit of the
moon Amalthea. It appears to be composed of dust raised up off Amalthea and
spiralling inward. Shown in red is a thicker, fainter ring of dust spiralling
inward from a smaller moon, Thebe. The faint blue extension to the Thebe ring
is unexplained. The thickness of each of these rings matches exactly the
vertical limits of the inclined orbit of its source moon.
