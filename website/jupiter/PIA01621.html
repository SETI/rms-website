**Caption:**

This mosaic of Jupiter’s ring system was acquired by NASA’s Galileo
spacecraft when the Sun was behind the planet, and the spacecraft was
in Jupiter’s shadow peering back toward the Sun.

In such a configuration, very small dust-sized particles are
accentuated so both the ring particles and the smallest particles in
the upper atmosphere of Jupiter are highlighted. Such small particles
are believed to have human-scale lifetimes, i.e., very brief compared
to the solar system’s age.

Jupiter’s ring system is composed of three parts: a flat main ring, a
toroidal halo interior to the main ring, and the gossamer ring, which
lies exterior to the main ring. Only the main ring and a hint of the
surrounding halo can be seen in this mosaic. In order to see the less
dense components (the outer halo and gossamer ring) the images must be
overexposed with respect to the main ring.

This composite of two mosaics was taken through the clear filter (610
nanometers) of the solid state imaging (CCD) system on November 9,
1996, during Galileo’s third orbit of Jupiter. The ring was
approximately 2,300,000 kilometers away.  The resolution is
approximately 46 kilometers per picture element from right to left;
however, because the spacecraft was only about 0.5 degrees above the
ring plane, the image is highly foreshortened in the vertical
direction. The vertical bright arcs in the middle of the ring mosaics
show the edges of Jupiter and are composed of images obtained by
NASA’s Voyager spacecraft in 1979.
