<p> <b>Latest update:</b> 2/26/13 - Amendment 2.</p>

<h3>Critical Dates</h3>
<ul>
 <b><p>Step-1 Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3/26/2013</p>
    <p>Step-2 Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5/3/2013 </p>
    <p>Data Availability date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2/2/2013</b> </p>

</ul>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>

<p> The Cassini Data Analysis and Participating Scientists Program (CDAPS)
      is described in Appendix C.10 of the ROSES 2013 NRA.
    The full document can be accessed under <b>Solicitations</b> at the
    <a href="//nspires.nasaprs.com/external/">NSPIRES web site.</a>
</p>

 <p>
 <p>The specific data restrictions given for the 2013
    CDAPS are:
 </p>

  <ul>

  <p>Proposals must be focused on the Saturn system and make
   significant use of (or greatly enhance the use of) data
   returned by Cassini instruments. Proposals to work with Cassini
   data and also use ground-based or other data are acceptable,
   provided that the success of the proposal, as written, is
   dependent upon the Cassini data.
  </p>

  <p>In the first two years of the CDAPS program data from the
   Cassini Jupiter flyby in 2000 were eligible. This is no longer
   true. Proposals that address Jupiter data should be directed to
   the Outer Planets Research program described in Appendix C.7 of
   this ROSES NRA.
  </p>

   <p>In order to be considered under the data analysis portion of
    the call, proposing PIs <b>must use data that are in the
    public domain 90 days before the CDAPS Step 2 proposals due
    date</b>, and they must
    make clear to the peer reviewers that the data are publicly
    available. Proposals that do not comply with this rule may be
    declared noncompliant and declined without evaluation. It is
    understood, however, that once the grant is awarded,
    succeeding years of work may address data that have
    subsequently come into the archive.
   </p>

   <p>Whether from the PDS or another source, if the data to be
    analyzed is not certified or otherwise has issues that might
    represent an obstacle to analysis, the proposers must clearly
    demonstrate that such potential difficulties can be overcome.
   </p>
  </ul>

 <p><b> Volumes at the Ring-Moon Systems Node</b> which meet the CDAPS basic
  eligibility requirements for publicly available timing (based on
  the Step 2 Proposal due date)and PDS certification are listed
  below.
 </p>
 <ul>
   <li>COCIRS_0401 through COCIRS_1203</li>
   <li>COCIRS_5401 through COCIRS_6006</li>
   <li>COISS_0001 through COISS_0011</li>
   <li>COISS_2001 through COISS_2073</li>
   <li>COISS_3001 through COISS_3007</li>
   <li>COUVIS_0004 through COUVIS_0038</li>
   <li>COVIMS_0004 through COVIMS_0051</li>
 </ul>

<p>In addition, Volumes <b>at the Ring-Moon Systems Node</b> which meet the CDAPS
  basic eligibility requirements for publicly available timing but which
  <b>have not</b> yet been certified by PDS are:
</p>
 <ul>
    <li>CORSS_8001</li>
    <li>COUVIS_8001</li>
    <li>COVIMS_8001</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Finding Cassini Data within the PDS</h3>

<b> Data at the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</b>

 <ul>
    <li><b> Search for data</b></li>

  <p> [OPUS]({{ site.baseurl }}/search/), our Outer Planets Unified
   Search tool, allows users to search for and obtain subsets of
   data based on a wide range of constraints. OPUS supports Saturn system
   data obtained by Cassini CIRS prior to July 2010, and all Saturn system
   observations currently available in PDS obtained by Cassini ISS, UVIS and
   VIMS, as well as data sets obtained by other missions including Voyager.
   Search results include preview images for all observations.</p>

 <p><b>For Cassini ISS, UVIS, and VIMS, the OPUS search parameters are based on
    enhanced geometric metadata generated at the rings node and include constraints
relating to the surfaces of the planet and satellites as well as to the rings.</b>
     </p>

    <li><b> Use our Cassini Information Pages</b></li>
  <p> Our [Cassini information pages]({{ site.baseurl }}/cassini/) provide:
    <ul>
      <li>tabular links to the data organized by observation date for each instrument,</li>
      <li>links to Ring-Moon Systems Node generated preview images (ISS, UVIS and VIMS) and footprint diagrams (CIRS), </li>
      <li>links to tables of enhanced geometric metadata, </li>
      <li>links to volumes of calibrated ISS images, </li>
      <li>overviews of the CIRS, ISS, UVIS, and VIMS instruments and their associated documentation.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p><li><b>Browse</b> our [data directories](/link/volumes/) </li></p>

  <p><li><b>Download</b> [entire volumes](/link/volumes/) as [tar.gz]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/targz.html) files.</li></p>

  <li><b> The PDS NAIF Node and observation geometry.</b></li>

  <p>SPICE data and software may be obtained from the
    <a href="//naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/">NAIF web site</a>.SPICE
   data files contain spacecraft and solar system geometry data
   necessary to interpret scientific observations from space-based
   instruments. The SPICE system also includes a large suite of
   software, mostly in the form of subroutines, that users
   incorporate in their own application programs to read SPICE
   files and to compute derived observation geometry, such as
   altitude, latitude/longitude, and lighting angles.
