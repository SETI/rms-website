## Welcome to the Ring-Moon Systems Node's ROSES 2013 NRA Support Pages

### Introduction

These pages are intended to assist proposers to the rings related programs in
the ROSES 2013 NRA.

Links to ROSES support pages at the other PDS Nodes can be found at the PDS
Engineering Node's [ ROSES support](//pds.nasa.gov/ROSES/roses.shtml)
page.

###  Notes

Each ROSES NRA discussed here includes specific requirements concerning the
public availability and quality of data intended for use in proposed research.
For most of these programs, the criteria for data available through the PDS
include whether or not the data has been certified by PDS.

On the "Data Status" tab, we identify the availability date and certified
status of each of the data sets or data volumes in the Ring-Moon Systems Node holdings.

**

Since several of the programs include encouragement or requirements to archive
the results of the proposed research, the "Archiving" tab provides information
and links to assist with archive planning and incorporating archive planning
in proposals.

The other tabs associated with this page provide information on data at the
the Ring-Moon Systems Node relevant to the specific NRA identified in the tab name, and
links to holdings at other PDS nodes which also may be relevant.

The following table gives the key dates for each of the NRA's supported by
these pages based on ROSES 2013. We will attempt to keep these pages current
as relevant amendments to ROSES 2013 are released. However, the definitive
source is of course the [NSPIRES web
site.](//nspires.nasaprs.com/external/)

**Latest update:** 10/18/13 - Amendment 27.

###  The Rings Related Research Programs

The links in the following table are to the respective Ring-Moon Systems Node support
pages (same destinations as the tabs at the top of the page).

Program | Appendix | NOI Due | Proposal Due  
---|---|---|---  
[Cassini Data Analysis and Participating Scientists Program (CDAPS)](cdaps.html) | C.10 | 3/26/13* | 5/3/13  
[Outer Planets Research (OPR)](opr.html) | C.7 | 8/23/13 | 11/15/13  
[Planetary Geology and Geophysics (PG&amp;G;)(pgg.html) | C.4 | 5/3/13 | 6/14/13  
[Planetary Mission DAP (PMDAP)**](pmdap.html) | C.11 | 8/16/13 | 10/28/13  
  

* **CDAPS**. 

**The Notice of Intent is replaced by a required Step-1 proposal. The Title and Team provided in Step-1 cannot change.**. The three page Step-1 proposal will be used to conduct a preliminary evaluation, which will result in full proposals being either encouraged or discouraged. 

** **PMDAP**. 

PMDAP affords a unique opportunity for ring scientists to propose for the
restoration of publicly available data sets. Individuals or teams interested
in pursuing this opportunity should [ contact us](/cgi-bin/comment-form.pl?)
early for assistance in identifying and obtaining eligible data, and in
determining the PDS compliance requirements for the completed deliverables.
