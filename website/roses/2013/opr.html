<h3>Critical Dates</h3>

<p><b> Updated 10/18/2013 based on Amendment 27. </b></p>

<ul>
 <b><p>Notice of Intent due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8/23/2013</p>
    <p>Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11/15/2013</p>
    <p>Data Availability date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11/15/2013</b> </p>
</ul>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>

<p> The Outer Planets Research (OPR) program is described in Appendix C.7 of the NRA.
    The full document can be accessed under <b>Solicitations</b> at the 
    <a href="//nspires.nasaprs.com/external/">NSPIRES web site.</a> 
</p>

<p>The specific data availability restrictions given for the 2013 OPR are:
</p>

 <ul>

   <p> "It is the responsibility of the investigators selected for 
   this program to acquire any needed data. Therefore, before 
   submitting a proposal, the investigator must determine that all 
   data required for the proposed investigation are publicly 
   available <b>[by the proposal due date]</b>. Proposals requiring 
    the use of data that are not 
   publicly available at the time of proposal submission may be 
   rejected without review."
 </p>

 <p> "Proposals dealing with mission data should provide convincing evidence 
  that currently available public data has sufficient quality and is 
  available in sufficient quantity to achieve the goals set forth in 
  the proposal."
 </p>
 </ul>

<p> <b> AS of 6/18/2013, volumes at the Ring-Moon Systems Node</b> which meet the 
  OPR basic eligibility requirements for <b>publicly available timing and 
  PDS certification</b> are listed below. </p>
 <ul>
    <li>ASTROM_nnnn</li>
    <li>COCIRS_0010 through 1203</li>
    <li>COCIRS_5401 through 6006</li>
    <li>COISS_0001  through 0011</li>
    <li>COISS_1001  through 1009</li>
    <li>COISS_2001  through 2075</li>
    <li>COISS_3001  through 3007</li>
    <li>COUVIS 0001 through 0039</li>

    <li>VG_2801, VG_2802, VG_2810</li>
    <li>VGISS_6101 through VGISS_6215 (Saturn)</li>
 </ul>

<p>In addition, the following Volumes <b>at the Ring-Moon Systems Node</b> meet the OPR 
  basic eligibility requirements for publicly available timing, but <b>are not 
  yet certified by PDS</b>. However, 
  for some proposals it may be possible to demonstrate that the "...data has 
  sufficient quality and is available in sufficient quantity to achieve the 
  goals set forth in the proposal."
</p>
<p> Proposers considering using any of the following should  
      <a href="/cgi-bin/comment-form.pl?"> contact us</a> early to discuss the 
      suitability of specific volumes for their planned research.
</p>

    <li>CORSS_8001</li>
    <li>COUVIS_8001</li>
    <li>COVIMS_8001</li>

<h3>Finding OPR Relevant Data within the PDS</h3>

<b> Data at the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</b>

 <ul> 
    <li><b> Search for data</b></li>
    
   <p><a href="/search/">OPUS</a>, our Outer Planets Unified 
   Search tool, allows users to search for and obtain subsets of 
   data based on a wide range of constraints. OPUS supports Cassini 
   CIRS, ISS, UVIS and VIMS data, New Horizons 
   Jupiter LORRI data, Galileo SSI data, and Voyager ISS data. 
   The results returned include preview products and tables of metadata.</p>


  <p><li><b>Browse</b> our <a href="/vol/">Data Directories</a> </li></p>
  
  <p><li><b>Download</b> entire volumes<a href="/archives/"> as tar.gz files.</a></li></p>

  
    <li><b> Use our Mission Information Pages</b></li>
    
 <p>Our mission information pages provide overviews of data sets and instruments along with 
    links to detailed descriptions of the instruments and to the data 
    and to Ring-Moon Systems Node generated browse images and footprint diagrams.</p>
  
  <ul> 
   <p><li><a href="/cassini">Cassini </a> Our Cassini mission pages support CIRS, 
    ISS, UVIS, and VIMS, including links to updated geometric metadata
        for these four instruments, plus occultation data obtained by RSS, UVS & VIMS, 
        and links to calibrated ISS images. </li>
   </p>
    
  <p><li><a href="/newhorizons/">New Horizons </a>. Our New Horizon page
     provides access to the full set of LORRI Jupiter data and SPICE files, browse images
     for the LORRI data, and links to the full New Horizons Jupiter data collection at the 
     Small Bodies Node.</li>
    </p>
                 
  <p><li><a href="/galileo/">Galileo. </a>Our Galileo page supports the Solid State 
    Imager (SSI) and the Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS).  </li>
    </p>
    
  <p><li><a href="/voyager/">Voyager. </a> Our Voyager pages 
   support ISS including new data sets of uncompressed, calibrated 
   and geometrically corrected images, IRIS, and occultation data 
   from PPS, UVS, and RSS. These pages also provide access to the 
   Voyager SPICE kernels generated at the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</li>
  </p>
    
  <p><li><a href="/urpx/">Uranus Ring Plane Crossing </a>. While 
   publicly available URPX observations obtained under Planetary 
   Astronomy Program are covered by this NRA, we do not currently 
   have any such data. If eligible URPX data becomes available at 
   the Ring's Node prior to the proposal deadline, this page will 
   reflect it. </li>
  </p>
 
  </ul>
 </ul>

<b> Data available at other PDS nodes.</b>
 <ul>  
  <li><b> The PDS NAIF Node and observation geometry.</b></li>

  <p>SPICE data and software may be obtained from the  
    <a href="//naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/">NAIF web site</a>.SPICE 
   data files contain spacecraft and solar system geometry data 
   necessary to interpret scientific observations from space-based 
   instruments. The SPICE system also includes a large suite of 
   software, mostly in the form of subroutines, that users 
   incorporate in their own application programs to read SPICE 
   files and to compute derived observation geometry, such as 
   altitude, latitude/longitude, and lighting angles.

<p><li>Links to ROSES support pages at the other PDS Nodes can be found at 
    the PDS Engineering Node's 
<a href="//pds.nasa.gov/ROSES/roses.shtml"> ROSES support</a> page.</li>
</p>

 <li>For PDS wide search, start with the 
    <a href="//pds.nasa.gov/tools/data-search/">PDS wide search engine</a>. 
    This search capability is limited, but initial results include links to relevant and much more 
    powerful discipline node search engines. </li>
