## Welcome to the Rings Node's ROSES 2015 NRA Support Pages

**Last updated: 5/01/2015, through Amendment 12.**

### Introduction

These pages are intended to assist proposers to the rings related programs in
the [ROSES 2015 NRA](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={9F1341A9-6D0F-F075-C993-276263B186ED}&path=future).

Links to ROSES support pages at the other PDS Nodes can be found at the PDS
Engineering Node's [ ROSES support](http://pds.nasa.gov/ROSES/roses.shtml)
page.

###  Notes

  * A two step proposal process.
    * A Step-1 proposal is required. Only proposers who submit a Step-1 proposal are eligible to submit a Step-2 proposal.
    * Full (Step-2) proposals must broadly contain the same scientific goals proposed in the Step-1 proposal.
    * For SSW, as part of the Step-1 review process all proposals will be directed to one of two Step-2 deadlines.
See the full NRA for complete details and restrictions.

  * For proposals that contain mission data analysis, planetary spacecraft mission data to be used in proposed investigations must be available in the Planetary Data System (PDS) or equivalent publicly accessible archive at least 30 days prior to the Step 2 proposal submission date.
    * See the "Data Status" tab for the availability date and "PDS Certification" status of each of the data sets or data volumes in the Rings Node holdings. 

  * Proposals submitted to ROSES-2015 are required to include a data management plan (DMP), unless explicitly noted by the specific program element. 

    * Guidelines for preparing PDS4 compliant submissions to the Planetary Data System are available at [ Archiving under PDS4](http://pds.nasa.gov/pds4/about/portal.shtml). 

The "Data Status" tab provides the availability date and "PDS Certification"
status of each of the data sets or data volumes in the Rings Node holdings.
The other tabs associated with this page provide information on data at the
Rings Node relevant to the specific AO identified in the tab name.

The following table gives the key dates for each of the NRA's supported by
these pages based on ROSES 2015. We will attempt to keep these pages current
as relevant amendments to ROSES 2015 are released. However, the definitive
source is of course the [NSPIRES web
site.](http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/)

###  The Rings Related Research Programs

The links in the following table are to the respective Rings Node support
pages (same destinations as the tabs at the top of the page).
