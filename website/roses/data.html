## Status and Availability dates

**Last updated: 10/14/2016, through Amendment 38.**

### Introduction

The following table lists data held at the PDS Ring-Moon Systems Node, generally by Volume
or Dataset ID, the date the data became publicly available, it's PDS
certification status, and the date the volume was certified.

  * **Dates**

In order to reduce the size of the table, for large, imcrementally delivered
data sets (e.g., Cassini data volumes), **all data available on or before
January 1st, 2012 are show as available on 2012-01-01**. For example, this
allows us to group all 67 volumes of Cassini ISS Saturn data submitted between
Jul 1st, 2005 and January 1st, 2012 on a single line. Certification date is
handled in the same fashion.

  * **PDS Certification**

Data sets that are appropriate for inclusion in NASA data analysis and other
proposals are those that have successfully completed the PDS peer review
process, or are about to pass, pending resolution of minor liens that the
review panel and relevant PDS Node deem not to impact the scientific integrity
of the data set. These data sets are considered "certified" by the PDS. Data
sets (or newly delivered, non-reviewed increments to dynamic data sets within
archives) that do not meet the above criteria are considered "non-certified"
and are clearly labeled as such on PDS web sites.

\#  COCIRS Saturn encounter volumes (COCIRS_0401 and later) contain two data sets: calibrated data, data set CO-S-CIRS-2/3/4-TSDR-V3.2, and highly derived data, data set CO-S-CIRS-5-CUBES-V1.0. There were several issues with the latter. In early May 2016, the CIRS team redelivered the entire set of volumes including corrected versions of data set CO-S-CIRS-5-CUBES-V1.0. For volume COCIRS_1506 and earlier, there are two certification dates. For the calibrated data, data set CO-S-CIRS-2/3/4-TSDR-V3.2, the certification date is essentially the data volume release date. For the data set of highly derived products, CO-S-CIRS-5-CUBES-V1.0, the certification date is 5/10/2016.

** The volumes of calibrated Voyager images produced at the Ring-Moon Systems Node were originally designated VGISS_0nnn, paralleling the organization of the original compressed, raw data volumes. Following the peer review of the Saturn data, we reorganized the data sets, electing to no longer parallel the volume organization of the original data. The new organization is essentially chronological, based on FDS count, with the data further subdivided by planetary system encounter.

    * VGISS_0004, VGISS_0005, VGISS_0026 - VGISS_0038 have been superseded by VGISS_6nnn (Saturn).
    * VGISS_0001 - VGISS_0003 have been superseded by VGISS_7nnn (Uranus).
    * VGISS_0006 - VGISS_0008, VGISS_0013 - VGISS_0025 have been superseded by VGISS_5nnn (Jupiter).
    * VGISS_0009 - VGISS_0012 have been superseded by VGISS_8nnn (Neptune).

*** The Ring-Moon Systems Node generates HST "volumes" which do not contain data. They point to data maintained at STScI. These volumes identify HST data, in the public domain, which contain observations of one or more outer planet system(s) (Jupiter through Pluto), and are used to support our search tool, OPUS. Since the data are maintained at STScI, PDS certification is not relevant.
