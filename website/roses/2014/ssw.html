    <p>Data Availability date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6/25/2014</b> </p>
</ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p> The Solar System Workings (SSW) program is described in Appendix C.3 and 
    Amendment 1 of the ROSES 2014 NRA.
    The full document can be accessed under <b>Solicitations</b> at the 
    <a href="//nspires.nasaprs.com/external/">NSPIRES web site.</a> 
</p>

<p><b> This is a very wide ranging call. While we provide a brief synopsis here, 
proposers must refer to the call for specifics.</b>
</p>

<p> The Solar System Workings program element supports research into 
    atmospheric, climatological, dynamical, geologic, geophysical, and 
    geochemical processes occurring on planetary bodies, satellites, 
    and other minor bodies (including rings) in the Solar System. This 
    call seeks to address the physical and chemical processes that 
    affect the surfaces, interiors, atmospheres, exospheres, and 
    magnetospheres of planetary bodies. A wide range of investigations 
    will be covered, including theoretical studies, analytical and 
    numerical modeling, sample-based studies of extraterrestrial 
    materials, field work, laboratory studies, and data synthesis 
    relevant to the physical and chemical processes affecting 
    planetary systems.
</p>


<h3>Data Sources</h3>

<p>The specific data availability restrictions given for 
    the 2014 SSW are given in Section C.1 of ROSES:
</p>

<ul>

<p> "For proposals that contain mission data analysis, planetary 
    spacecraft mission data to be used in proposed investigations must 
    be available in the Planetary Data System (PDS) or equivalent 
    publicly accessible archive at least 30 days prior to the proposal 
    submission date." </p>

<p> "Regardless of the archive(s) used, if the data to be analyzed 
    have issues that might represent an obstacle to analysis, the 
    proposers must demonstrate clearly and satisfactorily how such 
    potential difficulties will be overcome." </p> 
</ul>

<p> <b> AS of 2/26/2014, volumes at the Ring-Moon Systems Node</b> which meet the 
  SSW basic eligibility requirements for <b>publicly available timing and 
  PDS certification</b> are listed below. </p>
 <ul>
    <li>ASTROM_nnnn</li>
    <li>EBROCC_0001</li>
    <li>GO_0017 through 0023</li> 
    <li>NHJULO_1001 through NHJULO_2003</li>
    <li>NHSP_1000</li>
    <li>RPX_0001 through RPX_0401</li>
    <li>VG_0001 through VG_0038</li>
    <li>VG_2001</li>
    <li>VG_2801, VG_2802, VG_2810</li>
    <li>VGISS_5101 through VGISS_8210</li>
 </ul>

<p>In addition, the following Volumes <b>at the Ring-Moon Systems Node</b> meet the SSW 
  basic eligibility requirements for publicly available timing, but <b>are not 
  yet certified by PDS</b>. However, 
  for some proposals it may be possible to demonstrate that the "...data has 
  sufficient quality and is available in sufficient quantity to achieve the 
  goals set forth in the proposal."
</p>
<p> Proposers considering using any of the following should  
      <a href="/cgi-bin/comments/form.pl"> contact us</a> early to discuss the 
      suitability of specific volumes for their planned research.
</p> 
    
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>RES_0001</li>
  <li>VG_2803</li>  
  <li>VGIRIS_0001 through 0002</li>
 </ul>

<p> Finally, the Ring-Moon Systems Node generates HST "volumes" which do not contain data. They point to 
    data maintained at STScI. These volumes identify HST data, in the public domain,  which contain observations of one 
    or more outer planet system(s) (Jupiter through Pluto), and are used to support our search 
    tool, OPUS. Since the data are maintained at STScI, PDS certification is not relevant. 
</p>
 <ul>
  <li>HSTI1_1556 through HSTI1_3067<sup>*</sup></li>
  <li>HSTJ0_9296 through HSTJ1_2660<sup>*</sup></li>
  <li>HSTU0_5167 through HSTU1_1956<sup>*</sup></li>
</ul>

<h3>Finding SSW Relevant Data within the PDS</h3>

<b> Data at the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</b>

 <ul> 
    <li><b> Search for data</b></li>
    
   <p><a href="/search/">OPUS</a>, our Outer Planets Unified 
   Search tool, allows users to search for and obtain subsets of 
   data based on a wide range of constraints. OPUS supports Cassini 
   CIRS, ISS, UVIS and VIMS data, New Horizons 
   Jupiter LORRI data, Galileo SSI data, and Voyager ISS data. 
   The results returned include preview products and tables of metadata.</p>


  <p><li><b>Browse</b> our <a href="/webapps/link/volumes/">Data Directories</a> </li></p>
  
  <p><li><b>Download</b> entire volumes<a href="/webapps/link/archives-volumes/"> as tar.gz files.</a></li></p>

  
    <li><b> Use our Mission Information Pages</b></li>
    
 <p>Our mission information pages provide overviews of data sets and instruments along with 
    links to detailed descriptions of the instruments and to the data 
    and to Ring-Moon Systems Node generated browse images and footprint diagrams.</p>
  
  <ul> 
    
  <p><li><a href="/newhorizons/">New Horizons </a>. Our New Horizon page
     provides access to the full set of LORRI Jupiter data and SPICE files, browse images
     for the LORRI data, and links to the full New Horizons Jupiter data collection at the 
     Small Bodies Node.</li>
    </p>
                 
  <p><li><a href="/galileo/">Galileo. </a>Our Galileo page supports the Solid State 
    Imager (SSI) and the Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS).  </li>
    </p>
    
  <p><li><a href="/voyager/">Voyager. </a> Our Voyager pages 
   support ISS including new data sets of uncompressed, calibrated 
   and geometrically corrected images, IRIS, and occultation data 
   from PPS, UVS, and RSS. These pages also provide access to the 
   Voyager SPICE kernels generated at the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</li>
  </p>
 
   <p><li><a href="/hst/">HST. </a>Our HST page describes our HST holdings including
    the volumes in our "HST Observations of the Outer Planets" project which 
    provide references to HST observations made with either the ACS, 
    WFC3, or WFPC2 that included an outer planet system. The volumes are updated
    periodically and currently are complete through observations made during 
    the summer of 2012. </li>
    </p>
    
    
  <p><li><a href="/urpx/">Uranus Ring Plane Crossing </a>. While 
   publicly available URPX observations obtained under Planetary 
   Astronomy Program are covered by this NRA, we do not currently 
   have any such data. If eligible URPX data becomes available at 
   the Ring's Node prior to the proposal deadline, this page will 
   reflect it. </li>
  </p>
 
  </ul>

  <li><b> The PDS NAIF Node and observation geometry.</b></li>

  <p>SPICE data and software may be obtained from the  
    <a href="//naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/">NAIF web site</a>.SPICE 
   data files contain spacecraft and solar system geometry data 
   necessary to interpret scientific observations from space-based 
   instruments. The SPICE system also includes a large suite of 
   software, mostly in the form of subroutines, that users 
   incorporate in their own application programs to read SPICE 
   files and to compute derived observation geometry, such as 
   altitude, latitude/longitude, and lighting angles. 
   </p>
 </ul>
 
<h3>Archive Planning</h3>

 <ul>
 <p>Selected investigations may result in data products that 
    are of broad use to the science community, including 
    maps, data with improved calibrations, etc. NASA 
    strongly encourages that such data products be archived 
    in the Planetary Data System (//pds.nasa.gov/), or 
    equivalent public archive, by the end of the award 
    period. Proposers are advised to read C.1, The Planetary 
    Science Division Research Program Overview, for 
    information on including an archiving plan in the 
    proposal.
 </p>
    <ul><p><li>Requirements for depositing derived data products in the Planetary Data System have 
        been revised to require that all products be PDS4 conformant. Guidelines for planning 
        data in this format are available at 
        <a href = "//pds.nasa.gov/pds4"> Archiving under PDS4</a>.
    </li></p>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Additional links within PDS</h3>

<ul>
 <p><li>Links to ROSES support pages at the other PDS Nodes can be found at 
    the PDS Engineering Node's 
 <a href="//pds.nasa.gov/ROSES/roses.shtml"> ROSES support</a> page.</li>
 </p>
 
  <li>For PDS wide search, start with the 
    <a href="//pds.nasa.gov/tools/data-search/">PDS wide search engine</a>. 
    This search capability is limited, but initial results include links to relevant and much more 
    powerful discipline node search engines. </li>
