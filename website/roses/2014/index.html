## Welcome to the Rings Node's ROSES 2014 NRA Support Pages

**Latest update:** 6/23/14 - through Amendment 24.

### Introduction

These pages are intended to assist proposers to the rings related programs in
the [ROSES 2014 NRA](http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary
.do?method=init&solId={5924CEB3-4EB7-FEF1-C85B-DD5745C1331C}&path=open).

Links to ROSES support pages at the other PDS Nodes can be found at the PDS
Engineering Node's [ ROSES support](http://pds.nasa.gov/ROSES/roses.shtml)
page.

###  Notes

ROSES 2014 includes several significant changes: reorganization and
consolidation of programs, and more uniform requirements for proposal
submission across all of the programs.

  * A two step proposal process.
    * A Step-1 proposal is required. Only proposers who submit a Step-1 proposal are eligible to submit a Step-2 proposal.
    * Full (Step-2) proposals must broadly contain the same scientific goals proposed in the Step-1 proposal.
See the full NRA for complete details and restrictions.

  * For proposals that contain mission data analysis, planetary spacecraft mission data to be used in proposed investigations must be available in the Planetary Data System (PDS) or equivalent publicly accessible archive at least 30 days prior to the Step 2 proposal submission date.
    * See the "Data Status" tab for the availability date and "PDS Certification" status of each of the data sets or data volumes in the Rings Node holdings. 

  * Requirements for depositing derived data products in the Planetary Data System have been revised to require that all products be PDS4 conformant. Guidelines for planning data in this format are available at  Archiving under PDS4. 

The other tabs associated with this page provide information on data at the
the Rings Node relevant to the specific AO identified in the tab name.

The following table gives the key dates for each of the NRA's supported by
these pages based on ROSES 2014. We will attempt to keep these pages current
as relevant amendments to ROSES 2014 are released. However, the definitive
source is of course the [NSPIRES web
site.](http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/)

###  The Rings Related Research Programs
