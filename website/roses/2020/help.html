## Help for Proposal Writers

**Last updated: 02/25/2020, based on the 02/24/2020 amendment 2 of ROSES 2020.**

### Letter of Support

  - Most of the programs relevant to the Ring-Moon Systems Node require a letter of support from the intended curating node. <b>Proposers are strongly encouraged to contact the node well in advance (at least two weeks) of the proposal due date.</b> There are several steps the node must complete, including determining if archiving your data with this node is appropriate, prior to generating a letter of support. You will not be the only PI seeking a letter.

### Data Management Plans (DMP)

  - Most of the programs relevant to the Ring-Moon Systems Node require a DMP. For details relevant to a specific program see that program's instructions.

  - Proposers requiring a DMP are strongly encouraged to use the Planetary Science Division's DMP template, which may be downloaded as a word doc, or a latex template in the form of a .txt file from the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/templates-planetary-science-division-appendix-c-roses-proposals" target="_blank">SARA web page</a>.

### Use of Existing PDS Data Sets

  - Check the instructions for the program to which you are proposing for any rules concerning which PDS data sets are acceptable. Some programs have specific requirements about the status of PDS data sets for use in proposals.

  - The [Data Status](data.html) tab provides the availability date and "PDS Certification" status of each of the data sets or data volumes in the Ring-Moon Systems Node holdings.

  - When mentioning a PDS data set in your proposal, for PDS3 data, cite the PDS Data Set ID, which uniquely identifies the data set in all of PDS. Similarly for PDS4 data, cite the Bundle Logical Identifier (LID). Many data sets have similar names, so specifying the PDS3 Data Set ID or PDS4 LID avoids any ambiguity.

###  Generation of a New PDS Data Set

   Tasks involved in creating a new data set (considerations for laying out a Data Management Plan).

   **What The P.I. does:**

   - Produces data products in acceptable PDS format (currently PDS4).
   - Produces PDS labels, which under PDS4 are XML files.
   - Writes supporting documentation.
   - Organizes data, labels, documentation, etc. into an archive package.
   - Validates labels using PDS provided tools.
   - Participates in peer review (done via web, email and phone; no travel necessary).
   - Makes updates, as necessary, based on peer review recommendations.
   - Delivers final package to PDS.


   **What the PDS Node does (at no cost to the proposer):**

   - Provides advice on PDS standards and requirements.
   - Helps in designing PDS labels, if needed.
   - Provides available PDS tools.
   - Sets up and conducts a peer review.
   - Accepts the final package and integrates the data into its archives, including making it available on the Imaging Node web site.

### Contact PDS

   - If you intend to archive your data in PDS, discuss it with PDS before submitting
     your proposal. We can tell you what would be required to make your data into a compliant archive,
     and make sure you are connected with the right PDS node to handle your data. The node can
     provide a letter stating that it is aware of your proposed effort and can support the
     archiving of your data. Contact the RMS Node using **[our comments system]({{ site.baseurl }}/cgi-bin/comments/form.pl)**,
     or by emailing a member of staff - email addresses are included in the pages linked in the "Contacts" section
     of the navigation bar to the left of this and most of our web pages.
   - Which PDS node? Refer to the information about each of the PDS nodes available on the
     <a href="https://pds.nasa.gov/home/about/node-descriptions.shtml" target="_blank">main PDS website</a> node descriptions page.
     Or use the links to the individual PDS nodes at the bottom of this page, and look at the node's web site
     to see the types of data already archived there.


### Estimation of Effort.

   - Even if you are a seasoned PDS veteran, it's unlikely that you can simply deliver an archive-ready
     package to PDS at the end of your work. Your PDS representative will help you define your data
     structures, design PDS labels, design the components of the archive (data, documentation, index
     tables, supporting materials), and prepare for the peer review. Discuss the scope of the work needed
     to archive your data with your PDS representative to accurately estimate the effort required in your
     proposal.

### Peer Review.

   - Every data set archived in PDS must pass a peer review. The review committee consists of a small
     number of scientists who have relevant expertise, along with PDS representatives. The review results
     in a list of recommendations called liens that must be addressed before the data set can be accepted.
     When you're proposing for archiving support from NASA, you will need to commit to fully supporting
     the development and validation, delivery, review and lien resolution for your archive.

### Additional PDS Support

   - For more information about proposing with respect to PDS archiving, see the PDS Engineering Node's <a href="https://pds.nasa.gov/home/proposers/ " target="_blank">Information for Proposers</a> page.

   - From that page, follow the link to the Proposers to Individual R&A Programs page which contains links to several additional
     resources including one to the Proposer's Archiving Guide, written specifically to support DAP proposers, and links to ROSES
     support pages at the individual nodes..
