<h2>Planetary Data Archiving, Restoration, and Tools 2017</h2>

<p> <b>Last updated: 3/3/2017, through Amendment 2.</b> </p>

<h3>Critical Dates</h3>

<ul>
 <b><p>Step-1 proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5/11/2017</p>
    <p>Step-2 proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7/12/2017</p>
 </b> 
</p>
</ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p><b> We provide a brief synopsis here; proposers must refer to the call 
    for specifics.</b>
</p>

<p> The Planetary Data Archiving, Restoration, and Tools (PDART) 
    program is described in Appendix C.7. The full document can be 
    accessed under <b>Solicitations</b> at the <a 
    href="//nspires.nasaprs.com/external/">NSPIRES web site.</a> 
</p>

<p> The Planetary Data Archiving, Restoration and Tools (PDART) 
    solicits proposals to generate higher-order data products, archive 
    and restore data sets or products, create or consolidate reference 
    databases, digitize data, and develop or validate software 
    tools. 
</p>

<p> For all types of proposals, it is expected that the products of 
    selected proposals will be made available to the scientific 
    community via the NASA PDS or equivalent archive. All proposals 
    will be evaluated on the perceived impact of the new data products 
    or tools on future planetary science research and exploration.
</p>



 
<h3>Archive Planning</h3>

 <ul>
    <p><li>Proposals submitted to ROSES-2017 are required to include a data management plan (DMP).
         However, unlike for other programs, proposers to this program element will not provide a data 
         management plan via the NSPIRES cover pages. Instead, that requirement is superseded by instructions 
         in Appendix C.7 that place more detailed descriptions into the body of the 
         Scientific/Technical/Management section of proposals.
     </li></p>

<h3>Additional links within PDS</h3>

<ul>
   <p><li>The PDS has prepared a <a href="https://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/Individual-Proposers-Archive-Guide-v11.pdf"> Proposer's Archiving Guide</a>, 
	        specifically to support DAP proposers. 
   </p></li>
