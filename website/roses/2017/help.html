## Help for Proposal Writers

**Last updated: 3/3/2017, through Amendment 2.**

### Use of Existing PDS Data Sets

  - Check the instructions for the program to which you are proposing for any rules about which PDS data sets are acceptable. Some programs have specific requirements about the status of PDS data sets for use in proposals.

  - The "Data Status" tab provides the availability date and "PDS Certification" status of each of the data sets or data volumes in the Ring-Moon Systems Node holdings.

  - When mentioning a PDS data set in your proposal, for PDS3 data, cite the PDS Data Set ID, which uniquely identifies the data set in all of PDS. Similarly for PDS4 data, cite the Bundle Logical Identifier (LID). Many data sets have similar names, so specifying the PDS3 Data Set ID or PDS4 LID avoids any ambiguity.

###  Generation of a New PDS Data Set

   Tasks involved in creating a new data set (considerations for laying out a Data Management Plan).

   **What The P.I. does:**

   - Produces data products in acceptable PDS format (currently PDS4).
   - Produces PDS labels, which under PDS4 are XML files.
   - Writes supporting documentation.
   - Organizes data, labels, documentation, etc. into an archive package.
   - Validates labels using PDS provided tools.
   - Participates in peer review (done via web, email and phone; no travel necessary).
   - Makes updates, as necessary, based on peer review recommendations.
   - Delivers final package to PDS.


   **What the PDS Node does (at no cost to the proposer):**

   - Provides advice on PDS standards and requirements.
   - Helps in designing PDS labels, if needed.
   - Provides available PDS tools.
   - Sets up and conducts a peer review.
   - Accepts the final package and integrates the data into its archives, including making it available on the Imaging Node web site.

### Contact PDS

   - If you intend to archive your data in PDS, discuss it with PDS before submitting
     your proposal. We can tell you what would be required to make your data into a compliant archive,
     and make sure you are connected with the right PDS node to handle your data. The node can
     provide a letter stating that it is aware of your proposed effort and can support the
     archiving of your data.
   - Which PDS node? Links to all the PDS nodes are found underneath the bottom of this page.
     To determine if a node is the right one to archive your data, look at the node's web site
     to see the types of data already archived there. Contact information for all PDS nodes
     is available on their web sites and on the <a href="//pds.jpl.nasa.gov/contact/contact.shtml" target="_blank">main PDS website</a> Contact page. Contact the [Ring-Moon Systems Node]({{ site.baseurl }}/cgi-bin/comments/form.pl) here.

### Estimation of Effort.

   - Even if you are a seasoned PDS veteran, it's unlikely that you can simply deliver an archive-ready
     package to PDS at the end of your work. Your PDS representative will help you define your data
     structures, design PDS labels, design the components of the archive (data, documentation, index
     tables, supporting materials), and prepare for the peer review. Discuss the scope of the work needed
     to archive your data with your PDS representative to accurately estimate the effort required in your
     proposal.

### Peer Review.

   - Every data set archived in PDS must pass a peer review. The review committee consists of a small
     number of scientists who have relevant expertise, along with PDS representatives. The review results
     in a list of recommendations called liens that must be addressed before the data set can be accepted.
     When you're proposing for archiving support from NASA, you will need to commit to fully supporting
     the development and validation, delivery, review and lien resolution for your archive.

### Additional PDS Support

The PDS has prepared a <a href="https://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/Individual-Proposers-Archive-Guide-v11.pdf" target="_blank">Proposer's Archiving Guide</a>, specifically to support DAP proposers.

For more information about proposing with respect to PDS archiving, see the PDS Engineering Node's <a href="https://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/pds4/propose/proposing.shtml" target="_blank">Information for Proposers</a> page.

The PDS Engineering Node's <a href="//pds.nasa.gov/ROSES/roses.shtml" target="_blank">ROSES support</a> page includes links to ROSES support pages at the other PDS Discipline Nodes.
