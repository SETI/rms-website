## Mean Motion Resonances in Saturn's Main Rings

This data set consists of a collection of tables that contain the calculated
locations and "strengths" of mean motion resonances in the main rings of
Saturn plus supporting documentation files.

For each resonance, the tables give the argument, semi-major axis, mean
motion, and order of the resonance, and the lowest order strength terms from
the expansion of the disturbing function (i.e., potentials, not forces or
torques). Strength expressions include all terms up to 4th order in the
eccentricities and inclinations (2nd order for Pan and Daphnis). Resonances
are sorted by order (lowest order first) and then by semi-major axis.

For more information on the tables and the input parameters used to generate
them, see the file <a href="saturn_resonances.pdf" target="_blank">saturn_resonances.pdf</a>.
