      ![image](/assets/img/PDS Survey Ads - Live 1.png "Animated Juno Viewer"){:class="img-responsive"}


      **NASAâ€™s Science Mission Directorate (SMD) announces the release of the second annual Planetary Data System (PDS)
      Customer Satisfaction Survey (CSS).**


      Please assist NASA in defining the next generation of the PDS by participating in the [2022 Planetary Data System
      Customer Satisfaction Survey](//cfigroupfed.gov1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9EU3vxgeNksURqS){:target="_blank"}. Survey
      results will be used to identify and prioritize services, ensuring that the needs of the planetary science community are met.


      The anonymous online survey, developed for NASA by its contractor CFI Group, takes a few minutes, and optional
      fields are provided to register your concerns and comments.


      Please contact the PDS at [pds-operator@jpl.nasa.gov](mailto:pds-operator@jpl.nasa.gov) with questions on the survey.
      Information on how the PDS is responding to the first 2020 PDS survey is provided [here](https://pds.nasa.gov/home/community-announcement.shtml){:target="_blank"}.

  - title: Earth-Based Uranus System Stellar Occultations
    content: >

        + We have archived more than 50 data bundles of [Earth-based observations of stellar occultations of the Uranus system](/pds4/bundles/uranus_occs_earthbased/){:target="_blank"}.

        + Each bundle corresponds to a single occultation-telescope combination. These represent the highest quality observations spanning 25 years beginning with the ring system discovery observations by the Kuiper Airborne Observatory in 1977.

        + Users are strongly encouraged to review the [associated support bundle](/pds4/bundles/uranus_occs_earthbased/uranus_occ_support/){:target="_blank"} which includes a comprehensive Users Guide as well as models of the individual Uranian rings.

        + To download the entire set in a single TAR.GZ file, [click here](https://pds-rings.seti.org/pds4/archives-bundles/uranus_occs_earthbased){:target="_blank"}.
