  - title: Earth-Based Uranus System Stellar Occultations
    content: >

        + We have archived more than 50 data bundles of [Earth-based observations of stellar occultations of the Uranus system](/pds4/bundles/uranus_occs_earthbased/){:target="_blank"}.

        + Each bundle corresponds to a single occultation-telescope combination. These represent the highest quality observations spanning 25 years beginning with the ring system discovery observations by the Kuiper Airborne Observatory in 1977.

        + Users are strongly encouraged to review the [associated support bundle](/pds4/bundles/uranus_occs_earthbased/uranus_occ_support/){:target="_blank"} which includes a comprehensive Users Guide as well as models of the individual Uranian rings.

        + To download the entire set in a single TAR.GZ file, [click here](//pds-rings.seti.org/pds4/archives-bundles/uranus_occs_earthbased "Uranus Occultations tar.gz file"){:target="_blank"}.
