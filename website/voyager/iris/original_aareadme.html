## Introduction
{: #intro }

This volume contains IRIS full resolution spectral data and associated        
pointing and geometric information for the Voyager 1 and 2 Jupiter, Saturn,   
Uranus, and Neptune encounters.  Data contained here were obtained between    
1979 and 1989.

## Volume Information   
{: #information }

This disc contains full-resolution (RDR) spectral observations produced  
by the Voyager IRIS experiments for each encounter of the Voyager mission.    
Data are grouped in subdirectories for each of the Outer Planets;  within     
each subdirectory are the data files, PDS label files, and associated         
calibration files available for that planet. For Jupiter and Saturn, there    
are separate files for Voyager 1 and 2.

    This volume follows the structure outlined below:

## Disc Format
{: #disc_format }           

This disk has been formatted so that a variety of computer systems        
(e.g. IBM PC, Macintosh, Sun, VAX) may access the data.  Specifically,        
the disk is formatted according to the ISO 9660 level 1 Interchange           
Standard.  For further information, refer to the ISO 9660 Standard            
Document: RF# ISO 9660-1988, 15 April 1988.

## File Format
{: #file_format }

All data files on this disc are accompanied by detached                  
PDS labels, which describe their contents.  PDS TEXT                          
objects include attached labels.  All PDS labels include an SFDU              
label in the first record.  Labels have the same file name as the             
primary data file but have a suffix ".LBL" appended.                          
                                                                              
Each of the data and calibration files included here are in binary       
form, with the number of records and record structure documented in the       
associated PDS label files. 
 
To use the data files on VAX/VMS computer systems, the file              
characteristics will need to be modified using the VMS FILE utility.          
File modification should take the following form:

$ FILE data_file.dat/RECORD_SIZE=rrrr/MAXIMUM_RECORD_SIZE=rrrr

Following is a list of record sizes for each of the encounters' data          
and calibration files:                                                        
                                                                              
	Encounter	Record Size                                                        
        =========       ===========                                           
         Jupiter           4736                                               
         Saturn            4736

         Neptune           1760                                               
                                                                              
For example, to convert the data file VG1_SAT.DAT, issue the following        
command:

$ FILE VG1_SAT.DAT/RECORD_SIZE=4736/MAXIMUM_RECORD_SIZE=4736
