## Voyager IRIS Expanded Volumes VGIRIS_0001-2

We have prepared complete versions of the IRIS data sets from Jupiter and
Saturn, with reformatted data. They are ready for peer review at the Rings
Node.

Each data set includes all the data from the encounter, not just that obtained
within a few days of closest approach. In these data sets, the data are in
binary and ASCII formats compatible with all modern computer systems.

Comments are welcome. Note, the Uranus and Neptune data sets were obtained in
a different format, and expanded archives are not currently planned.

  * Clicking on the VOLUME_ID will allow you to browse the volume.

  * To download an entire volume, right click on that volume's "Bundled" link in the second column.

The bundled volumes are provided in .tar.gz format. For information on opening
files of this type, click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/targz.html).
