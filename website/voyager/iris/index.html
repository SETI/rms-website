## Overview

Voyager's Infrared Spectrometer (IRIS) acts as three separate instruments.
First, it is a very sophisticated thermometer. It can determine the
distribution of heat energy a body is emitting, allowing scientists to
determine the temperature of that body or substance. Second, the IRIS is a
device that can determine when certain types of elements or compounds are
present in an atmosphere or on a surface. Third, it uses a separate radiometer
to measure the total amount of sunlight reflected by a body at ultraviolet,
visible, and infrared frequencies.

The Voyager IRIS instrument obtained one thermal spectrum every 48 seconds (or
"FDS count") throughout each planetary flyby. The instrument was devoted
primarily to atmospheric observations, but it did acquire numerous thermal
spectra of Saturn's ring system.
