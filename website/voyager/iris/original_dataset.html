The data set contains measurements from both the infrared interferometer
spectrometer and the broadband reflected solar radiometer and ancillary data.
The data set is ordered by time as measured by the Flight Data System Count
(FDSC). This represents the data frame number, modulo 60. Also included is
pointing and other information on the geometry associated with a given data
record.

Each record of the data set contains a header, radiometer observations, and
interferometer observations.

The interferometer data consists of calibrated thermal emission spectra
expressed as spectral radiances in Watt/cm**2/sr/cm**-1. The wavenumber
corresponding to each spectral radiance value is not included in the data set;
the beginning wavenumber and the constant wave number increment are given,
permitting easy calculation of the appropriate wavenumber for each radiance.
The calibrated radiances have been obtained from the directly measured
interferograms of the planetary body, along with deep space calibration
observations. The interferograms are first symmetrized to correct for the fact
that they are not sampled at zero path difference and to also remove the
asymmetry due to residual dispersion in the beamsplitter and compensator. The
symmetrized interferograms are then apodized using a Hamming function and are
cosine-transformed. The responsivity obtained from the deep space measurements
and knowledge of the instrument temperature are then used to obtain calibrated
radiances.

The radiometer data include a measurement integrated over the 45.6 sec
required to take one interferogram and measurements sampled 8 times during the
data frame. The latter include both high and low gain measurements. A steady
target yields identical signals for the 8 samples each of high and normal gain
data, and for the integrated data, within the resolution of each measurement.
The integrating radiometer provides the best resolution (by a factor of ~3);
however, for an accurate integrated measurement the target must remain stable
in the field of view for an entire frame, which seldom happens.

Radiometer data are presented as Watts at the detector (wad), which is the
integral across the instrument passband of the wavenumber-dependent power
received at the detector (wad(nu)). For a target filling the instrument field
of view:



            wad(nu) = Signal at instrument * instrument factor
                    = Target object illumination
                      * target object reflectance
                      * instrument grasp
                      * instrument filter function


For the IRIS measurements, the target is illuminated by the sun; the target
object reflectance is described by the bidirectional reflectance function; the
instrument grasp is the telescope area-solid angle product, A * omega,
multiplied by an obscuration factor, g; and the instrument filter function, t,
is the wavelength dependent instrument passband.

Integrating over the passband gives: wad = I * (A * omega * g) * t

where I is the spectrally integrated radiance from the target, and t is the
spectrally integrated radiance as attenuated by the instrument, normalized by
the entering flux; as such, it is independent of the normalization of the
target BDRF, and can be calculated using a normalized reflectance spectrum.
The spectral geometric albedo, as determined from groundbased measurements was
used [HANELETAL1981A].

The flux measured by the IRIS instrument is therefore:

I = WAD / (A * omega * g * t)




            where:
              A *  omega * g   = 0.02535
              t (Jupiter)      = 0.173 +/- 0.003
              t (Io)           = 0.171 +/- 0.003
              t (Europa)       = 0.173 +/- 0.003
              t (Ganymede)     = 0.168 +/- 0.003
              t (Callisto)     = 0.163 +/- 0.003
              t (target plate) = 0.156 +/- 0.002

## Confidence Level Note
{: #con_level }

In evaluating the confidence level of a given data record, several factors
should be taken into account. These include the interferometer data quality,
instrument temperature drift, field of view smear, and pointing accuracy.

The interferometer data quality is indicated in the data sets by the parameter
REJECT_CODE. The various values of this parameter have the following meaning:



              0 = good
              1 = too many spikes in interferogram
              2 = missing data in interferogram
              3 = zero peak in interferogram
              4 = no interferogram data, but
                  radiometer data are available
              5 = interferogram symmetrization problem


Only code 0 indicates the interferogram is usable; however, the radiometer
data may be available in the other cases.

When spectral data are selected for analysis, care must be taken to insure
that excessive motion of the field of view on the target body has not occurred
during the time the interferogram is taken. Smearing can be checked for by
noting the differences in latitude/longitude of the Q5 points (center of field
of view) at line counts 350 and 750. An additional check can sometimes be made
by noting variations in the sampled radiometer data during a frame. Since the
total infrared energy and the very low resolution components of the spectral
data are recorded in a brief time surrounding the interferogram peak, even
when smear occurs this information can be associated with the pointing
information at the 24 second point, as can radiometer sample #3.

A change in detector temperature can cause a shift in the absolute calibration
of the measured infrared radiance. The detector temperature, IR_DET_TEMP,
should be within 0.1 or 0.2K of 200K. If it is not, the spectrum can be
corrected using I(corrected) = I(uncorrected) - B(IR_DET_TEMP) + B(200) where
B(T) is the Planck radiance at temperature T.

The Noise Equivalent Spectral Radiance (NESR) provides a measure of the random
errors of the spectra, expressed in radiometric units. It is defined as the
radiance corresponding to a signal to noise ratio of unity and represents the
one-sigma uncertainty in an individual spectrum. It is calculated from the
standard deviation of measurements taken while the instrument is viewing deep
space. Values of the NESR at selected wave numbers are given in the following
table. A detailed listing of NESR versus wave number can be found in the NESR
files included with each data set volume.

Radiometer calibration consists of a verification of instrument stability by
repeated determinations of t(target plate), based on observations of a
diffusely scattering target plate mounted on the spacecraft. The calibration
conversion to Watts at the detector takes into account the detector response
and electrical gains. Observations of the target plate were carried out before
and after each encounter with the exception of after the Voyager 2 Saturn
encounter when jamming of the instrument scan platform caused the maneuver to
be aborted. The spacecraft was oriented so that an on- board, diffusely
scattering target plate was illuminated by the sun at 30 degrees from the
surface normal of the plate. The plate was then viewed by IRIS, to provide a
check on the stability of the radiometer calibration, and by the other scan
platform-mounted instruments. Each observational sequence proceeded as
follows: view deep space, view target, view deep space (occasionally an
interval is included when the IRIS field of view is only partially on the
target; this results in data with an intermediate signal level in the data
set). The difference in signals between target and space observations is then
multiplied by the square of the spacecraft-sun distance to provide a
normalized calibration signal (the calibration factor).

The principal sources of uncertainty are possible system nonlinearities,
signal variability associated with instrument response to changing orientation
relative to the sun, signal variability associated with sudden acquisition or
loss of the bright target, and quantization. At Jupiter and Saturn, overall
uncertainty is dominated by possible system nonlinearities (estimated as =<
0.5%). Otherwise, fluctuations in the deep space signal due to excursions in
scan platform pointing immediately before and after viewing the target are
significant; these arise because the instrument has a transient response to
time- varying illumination by the sun. Transients due to abrupt acquisition of
the target damp out in the first few frames of the target observation.

Files containing the target plate observations are included with each data set
volume. The data format follows that of the standard Voyager IRIS records.
However, all of the spectral data have been set to zero. Bad or missing
integrated radiometer and normal gain radiometer data have also been set to
zero; however, bad or missing normal gain radiometer data have been set to a
constant negative value (corresponding to -1 DN, since the normal gain
radiometer offset for Voyager 1 IRIS is equal to 0 DN). Tables summarizing the
radiometer calibrations are contained in the calibration section of the
Voyager 1 and 2 IRIS instrument catalog templates.

The pointing information provided in the SEDRs is derived from knowledge of
the spacecraft position (determined from trajectory analysis), the spacecraft
orientation (as indicated by sun and star sensor data and by displacements
within the limit cycle), and the articulation of the scan platform on which
the instruments are mounted. When adequate data are not available (due to
downlink loss, for example), predicted values for pointing information are
used. The quoted 3-sigma pointing uncertainty is 0.15 degrees (to be compared
with the 0.25 degree diameter of the IRIS field of view). In addition, there
are sometimes systematic errors in the SEDR pointing values for entire data
sequences or links that take the form of approximately constant offsets in the
given field of view locations on the picture body. When high accuracy in
pointing knowledge is required, it is best to refer directly to images
obtained simultaneously with the IRIS data, using the pointing changes between
the line count 350 and 750 Q5 values to correct for spatial drift between the
times of interferogram peaks and the shuttering of images. In correlating
images and IRIS observations, note that images are not read out during the
frames in which they are shuttered. When a single image is made during a
frame, its assigned FDSC is one decimal count (modulo 60) greater than the
FDSC of that frame. When both cameras are shuttered simultaneously (in the
imaging modes BOTSIM and BSIMAN), the narrow angle image of the pair is read
out first (with FDSC augmented by 0.01), and the wide angle image is read out
second (with FDSC augmented by 0.02). IRIS FDSCs are never augmented.

When attempting to correlate IRIS data with that from other Voyager
instruments, it may be necessary to take into account the relative offsets of
the centers of the fields of view of the various instruments. Offsets relative
to the center of the ISS Narrow Angle camera field of view are given in the
tables below. Elevation is positive to the right within the imaging field of
view and crosselevation is positive downward. The offsets are expressed both
in degrees and in Narrow Angle pixels.

One difference should be noted between the IRIS data sets described here and
those previously deposited in the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC
data set I.D. Numbers: 77-084A-03A; 77-084A-03B; 77-076A-03A; 77-076A-03B; 77
-076A-03C; 77-076A-03D). The spectral radiances in the earlier data sets were
listed with a wave number spacing of 1.39051 cm**-1. This represents a
significant over sampling of the data for which the apodized spectral
resolution is 4.3 cm**-1. In order to make the present data set more compact,
the sampling interval for the spectral radiances was reduced to 2.15 cm**-1.
This was accomplished by Fourier transforming the original data, resampling at
larger intervals, and transforming back to the spectral space. It should be
noted that the full intrinsic information content of the data has been
preserved with this procedure, and the two forms of presentation of the data
are entirely equivalent insofar as the information content is concerned.
