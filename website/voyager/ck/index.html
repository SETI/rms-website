SPICE C kernels contain the pointing and orientation history of spacecrafts.

For more information about SPICE visit the home page of PDS's [Navigation and
Ancillary Information Facility](//naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/){:target="_blank"} (NAIF).

## SEDR Files

Traditionally, the pointing information for the Voyager instruments was
distributed in the form of Supplemental Experiment Data Record (SEDR) files.
These were generated shortly after each flyby and were distributed on 9-track
tape. The format of the tapes was unique to each instrument but at minimum the
tapes contained the direction in space that the instrument was pointed. Today,
many of the SEDR tapes have been lost.

The one major exception is Voyager's Imaging Science Subsystem
([ISS]({{ site.baseurl }}/voyager/iss/index.html)), for which the SEDR files were later converted to
Vax binary format and are still widely available. However, the ISS SEDR files
only describe the camera direction and orientation at the time when images
were taken, leaving large intervals during each flyby when the pointing is
unknown.

The Ring-Moon Systems Node has recently obtained SEDR files for the Ultraviolet
Spectrometer ([UVS]({{ site.baseurl }}/voyager/uvs/index.html)), which have the advantage that they
provide nearly complete temporal coverage of each encounter. However, the
accuracy is not as good as that of the ISS SEDR files.

These files will be posted on line shortly, along with complete descriptive
information. Meanwhile, contact [Mark Showalter](//www.seti.org/our-scientists/mark-showalter){:target="_blank"} if you
would like any of these files.

## C Kernels

Unfortunately, because the Voyager mission pre-dates the PDS and the SPICE
toolkit, reliable C kernels were never generated for the scan platform, which
carried the four remote sensing instruments: [ISS]({{ site.baseurl }}/voyager/iss/index.html),
[IRIS]({{ site.baseurl }}/voyager/iris/index.html), [PPS]({{ site.baseurl }}/voyager/pps/index.html), and
[UVS]({{ site.baseurl }}/voyager/uvs/index.html). The Ring-Moon Systems Node has recently undertaken the project
of generating reliable C kernels for all of the Voyager flybys.

For completeness and to preserve historical information, the C kernels are
being generated in five versions:

1\. The ISS pointing information exactly as recorded by the ISS SEDR files.
These C kernels are discontinuous; they only contain the pointing information
at the times when images were taken.

2\. The UVS pointing information exactly as recorded by the UVS SEDR files.
These kernels have been interpolated to provide continuous and nearly-complete
temporal coverage, although with less accuracy than the Version #1 ISS-based C
kernels.

3\. Merged C kernels, in which the UVS SEDR information has been used to
interpolate between the times of the images. These kernels have the accuracy
of the Version #1 C kernels but also the temporal coverage of the Version #2
kernels.

4\. "C-smithed" C kernels for ISS, in which a subset of the images have been
used to correct pointing errors in the original ISS SEDR files. These kernels
should be significantly more accurate than the Version #1 kernels. However,
they are discontinuous, containing pointing information only at the times of
the Voyager images.

5\. Finally, merged, "C-smithed" kernels, in which the UVS SEDR files have
been used to interpolate between the times of the images. These should be as
reliable as the Version #4 C-smithed kernels but also provide continuous,
nearly-complete temporal coverage.

**NOTE**: These files have not yet been through peer review. We believe them to
be accurate but further testing is probably appropriate. Please send any questions
or problems to [Matt Tiscareno](//www.seti.org/our-scientists/matthew-tiscareno){:target="_blank"}.

## Downloads

Follow the links below for more information and files to download. Check back
later for additional C-smithed and merged C kernels. In the table below, "Type
1" refers to a kernel that only records pointing at discrete times (e.g.,
versions #1 and #4) whereas "Type 3" refers to a continuous kernel. Note that
the latter are much larger, and so the Type-1 kernels are probably more
appropriate for users only interested in the Voyager images.
