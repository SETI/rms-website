## Scientific Objectives
{: #sci_obj }

The primary scientific objectives of the photopolarimeter investigation on the
Voyager mission were divided into three categories:

(1) the study of atmospheric properties,

(2) the study of surface properties of satellites where little or no
atmosphere exists

(3) the study of planetary ring systems.

Additionally, the search for dark side auroral emissions provided both
magnetic field and charged particle information, as well as atmospheric data.

Specific scientific objectives associated with the atmospheres of Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Titan, and Triton were:

(1) to use intensity and polarization measurements as a function of viewing
angle, wavelength, and latitude to determine the vertical distribution of
cloud particles (atmospheric aerosols) down to an optical depth of unity, as
well as information on particle size, shape, and composition

(2) to use observations of the extinction and scattering of starlight to
determine atmospheric optical depth as a function of altitude.

Specific scientific objectives associated with the surfaces of satellites
were:

(1) to measure or set upper limits on the density of their atmospheres

(2) to determine the surface texture and probable composition

(3) to determine the bond albedo.

Specific scientific objectives for the study of planetary rings were:

(1) to use intensity and polarization measurements of scattered light as a
function of wavelength and viewing angle to provide information on the size,
shape, and probable composition of the ring particles, as well as their
density and radial distribution

(2) to use observations of the extinction and scattering of starlight to give
additional information on particle size and ring optical depth.

## Detectors and Optics
{: #det_opt }

The Voyager Photopolarimeter Experiment (PPS) utilized a general purpose
filter photometer/polarimeter optimized for the encounter phase of the
mission. The instrument consisted of a 6-inch f/1.4 Dahl-Kirkham type
Cassegrain telescope with a four-position aperture wheel providing Gaussian
fields of view (FOV) with full widths at half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.12, 0.25,
0.8, and 3.5 degrees. Behind this were mounted an eight position analyzer
wheel with five positions for polacoat analyzers, the transmitting axes of
which were oriented at 0, 60, 120, 45, and 135 degrees, and three positions
for open, dark, and calibration, an eight position filter wheel with thin film
interference filters, and an EMR 510-E-06 photomultiplier tube (PMT) with a
tri-alkali (S-20) photocathode. Individual photon events in the PMT were
detected with pulse counting electronics (LILLIE_ETAL_1977).

The wide dynamical range required by the mission (4 to 6.e11 photons
/cm^2/s/Angstrom/ster) could thus be accommodated by FOV changes and gain
change in the PMT capable of reducing the instrumental sensitivity by a factor
of approximately 50.

The PPS massed a total of 2.55 kg, including 0.78 kg of tungsten and aluminum
shielding to protect critical components from radiation trapped in the Jovian
magnetosphere. A shadow caster prevented direct sunlight from entering the
aperture of the instrument for phase angles less than 160 degrees. A solar
sensor was provided to turn off the high voltage if the instrument was pointed
within 20 degrees of the Sun.

The effective wavelength of each filter, its nominal band width, typical
instrumental sensitivities, and the particular atomic and molecular species to
which it is sensitive are listed below.

## Operational Modes
{: #op_mode }

The planned normal operational (encounter) mode of the PPS was to step through
a programmed sequence of 40 filter/analyzer wheel combinations once every 24
sec. Each measurement was to consist of a 400 millisecond integration period
followed by a 200 ms period during which the next filter or analyzer would be
stepped into place. A full measurement set would thus consist of readings in
the open, 0 degrees, 60 degrees, 120 degrees, and dark positions of the
analyzer wheel for each of the eight filters. Equipment failures and improved
understanding of instrument usage considerations, however, caused substantial
changes in this plan. See the section on operational considerations for
further details.

For stellar occultation and satellite eclipse measurements, the experiment was
operated with filters and analyzers fixed in position and a 10 ms integration
period. This provided rapid measurements in order to resolve spikes in the
light curves due to turbulence in the occulting planet's atmosphere, as seen
in Earth-based observations. Unlike other observational modes, data obtained
during this mode were not subjected to compression.

For ring observations, stellar occultations (delta Scorpio at Saturn, beta
Perseus at Uranus, sigma Sagittarius at Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) were
observed using filter #4 (2650 Angstroms) and polarizer #7 (45 degrees). A 10
ms integration time was used to get maximum time resolution and the FOV set to
0.8 degrees.

All the above measurement sequences could be modified during flight by
changing the PPS look-up-tables (LUT) in the spacecraft's Flight Data System
(FDS). These controlled the filter and analyzer wheel positioning and changed
according to mission phase and FDS count. The variations were predominantly a
result of instrument electronic failures and PMT usage issues more fully
understood as the mission progressed. Knowledge of which FDS load was in
effect during each data observation is therefore necessary for proper
analysis.

## Calibration
{: #cal }

Inflight calibration of the experiment was accomplished by observing a set of
standard stars of known brightness and polarization, the sunlight scattered by
an on-board calibration target, and the light from stars and the planets
reflected into the PPS from a mirror tilted to the Brewster angle. An internal
Cerenkov radiation source mounted on the analyzer wheel provided a short term
measure of the instrument's stability but was not used because comparison pre-
flight calibration data was lost.

The instrument was capable of measuring the polarization of reflected light
from the planets and their satellites with a precision of +/- 0.5 %, and their
relative brightness with an accuracy of +/- 0.5 to 1.0 %. Absolute calibration
was known to +/- 3 % in the visible and infrared, and to +/- 10 % in the UV.
For measurements of low surface brightnesses the instrument's sensitivity
ranged from about 140 counts/Rayleigh in the visible and UV to about 20
counts/Rayleigh in the infrared (LILLIE_ETAL_1977).

Distance from the target body was determined from other experiments on board.
Further discussions of intensity and polarization measurements can be found
in, for example, WEST_ETAL_1981, WEST_ETAL_1983, PRYOR_AND_HORD_1991.

## Operational Considerations
{: #op_con }

The PPS aboard Voyager 1 suffered extreme sensitivity loss before and during
Jupiter encounter. This was deemed to be irreparable and the instrument was
turned off before Saturn encounter. Voyager 1 data were never analyzed nor
archived.

The PPS instrument on board Voyager 2 suffered two hardware failures that
affected the ability to access wheel positions. A spacecraft decoder failure
affected the analyzer and a PPS internal chip failure affected the available
filter positions. At Jupiter, filter positions 0, 2, 4, and 6 were used.
Afterwards, only three positions, 2, 4, and 6, were utilised. Four of the
eight analyzer wheel positions were available. Of these, 135 and 45 degree
orientations at wheel positions 6 and 7 were used to acquire polarization
information. Before closest approach at Jupiter, data taken are unreliable due
to scattered light.

Measurement sequences were modified by changing the PPS look-up-table (LUT) in
the spacecraft's Flight Data System (FDS). This controlled the filter and
analyzer wheel positioning. The variations were predominantly a result of
sequencing considerations, i.e. where slews ended and images were shuttered,
as well as the above-mentioned instrument electronic failures and PMT usage
issues more fully understood as the mission progressed. Knowledge of which FDS
load was in effect during each data observation is therefore necessary for
proper analysis.

## Data Rate and Compression
{: #data_com }

The PPS data readout consists of a 30-bit digital word, of which 20 bits
provided the data count accumulated during the integration period, and 10 bits
indicated instrument status. In order to reduce the telemetry rate, data count
bits were log compressed in the spacecraft FDS to 14 bits (a 10 bit mantissa
and 4 bit exponent). Log compression was removed from the FDS for the PPS
occultation modes. The nominal data rate was thus 40 bps, with a maximum of
1023 1/2 bps and a minimum of 0.6 bps."
