                VOYAGER RING OCCULTATION DATA ARCHIVE
                -------------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION

This volume contains the data from the radio occultation experiments
at Saturn (Voyager 1) and Uranus (Voyager 2). Only highly processed
ring occultation data are provided. Also provided are ancillary files
containing geometry and calibration models, plus software tools for
manipulating the data.

This data set represents the third component of a data set collection
which also includes the Voyager Photopolarimeter (PPS) and Ultraviolet
Spectrometer (UVS) ring occultation data sets.

Supporting documentation and label files conform to the Planetary Data
System (PDS) Standards, Version 3.5, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)
document JPL D-7669 (October 15, 2003).

2. VOLUME FORMAT

This disk has been formatted according to the ISO 9660 Level 1
Interchange Standard. This format is compatible with a large variety
of computer systems (e.g. Sun, HP, Macintosh, PC). For further
information, refer to the ISO 9660 Standard Document, RF# ISO
9660-1988, 15 April 1988.

3. FILE FORMATS

3.1 FILE EXTENSIONS

Files on this volume are named according to PDS standards, where the
1-3 characters after the period indicate the file type. The file types
used on this volume are:

Binary files:
    Binary data files                          *.DAT
    SPICE ephemeris files                      *.BSP
    Adobe Acrobat documentation files          *.PDF
    Postscript documentation files             *.PS

ASCII text files:
    PDS labels                                 *.LBL
    ASCII tables and indices                   *.TAB
    PDS catalog files                          *.CAT
    Text documentation files                   *.TXT
    Source code files                          *.C, *.H, *.FOR, *.INC,
                                               *.PRO, *.C1, *.H1, *.F1
    Software build scripts                     *.COM, *.MAK, *.DEF
    SPICE kernels                              *.TLS, *.TPC
    SPICE transfer ephemeris files             *.XSP
    Other files (for documentation only)       *.FIT, *.LOG, *.OUT

3.2 PDS LABELS

Every file in this data set is described by an associated PDS label.
Most files are described by a detached label, which has the same name
as the corresponding file but an extension ".LBL". Most text files
(*.TXT, *.CAT) have attached labels.

In some cases, all or most of the files in a given directory share a
single, abbreviated "combined-detached" label.  In this case, the name
of the file is the name of the enclosing directory, with extension
".LBL".

See the PDS Standards Reference (JPL D-7669) for a complete
description of the PDS label format. This document can also be found
online at
        http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/stdref/

3.3 ASCII TEXT FILES

Different popular operating systems use different standards for how
ASCII text files are formatted. On Unix systems, lines are terminated
by a &gt;LF&lt; (linefeed character, control-J, ASCII 10). On Macintosh
computers, lines are terminated by a &gt;CR&lt; (carriage return character,
control-M, ASCII 13). On PCs, lines are terminated by a &gt;CR&lt;&gt;LF&lt; pair.
PDS standards require all text files to use &gt;CR&lt;&gt;LF&lt; line termination.
If the PDS label indicates INTERCHANGE_FORMAT = ASCII or RECORD_TYPE =
STREAM, then this line termination is in use.

On occasion, users on Unix and Macintosh computers may need to change
the line termination on some text files before they can use them. This
can be handled via text editors or a variety of utilities. For
example, the Unix tr (translate) command can be used to change
carriage returns to blanks:
    tr "\015" " " &gt;oldfile.txt &lt;newfile.txt

Some ASCII tables indicate RECORD_TYPE = FIXED_LENGTH and include an
additional parameter RECORD_BYTES, which indicates the length in bytes
of each record in the file.  It should be noted that all ASCII files
still include the &gt;CR&lt;&gt;LF&lt; line terminators, and these two bytes are
included in the byte count.  For this reason, it is unwise to convert
the line terminator to a single character (&gt;LF&lt; on Unix or &gt;CR&lt; on
Macintosh) because this can change the number of bytes per record and
invalidate the label.  In these situations, it is recommended that the
line terminator be replaced by a space plus &gt;LF&lt; or a space plus &gt;CR&lt;
instead.

3.4 BINARY FORMATS

Binary data file formats differ among hardware platforms. Most binary
files are provided in these formats:

IEEE: For Sun, SGI and Macintosh platforms. Integers appear with most
significant byte first; floating-point numbers appear in IEEE format.

PC: For PC platforms. Integers appear with least significant byte
first; floating-point numbers appear in byte-reversed IEEE format.

Vax: For DEC (now HP) VMS platforms. Integers appear with least
significant byte first; floating-point numbers appear in Vax G format.
Although not widely used today, this is the platform on which most
Voyager data were originally used. Note that, for files containing
nothing but integers, the PC versions of files can be used.

Note that the software tools included in the SOFTWARE/PROFILE
subdirectory take care of all data conversions automatically.

The SPICE subdirectory contains ephemeris files for Voyager, planets
and satellites, plus the Sun, Earth, and Moon. These files are
provided in SPICE format for a variety of platforms. For more
information about SPICE data and toolkits, consult the PDS Navigation
and Ancillary Information (NAIF) Node at
        http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/naif.html

4. VOLUME CONTENTS

4.1 FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS

ISO-9660 Level 1 standards require that file names be a maximum of
eight characters. Most of the supported data files provided on this
volume are based on the following nomenclature:

Characters 1-3: Experiment indicator
    1st character: R for RSS.
    2nd character: S for Saturn; U for Uranus.
    3rd character: 1-5, indicating a version number for the data
                   as obtained from the Stanford RSS team.

Character 4: File type
    C = calibration models.
    D = edited data containing complex transmissivities.
    G = geometry files.
    P = resampled, calibrated profiles.
    R = raw data.

Character 5: Version number
    A number indicating the version number of the given file. In
    general, the meaning of this number depends on the experiment and
    file type.

Characters 7-8: Supplemental
    These characters are only used when needed to further identify a
    file. They are used to distinguish rings, ingress vs. egress,
    coordinate frames, binary data formats, etc. These characters are
    explained in the *INFO.TXT file in each relevant subdirectory.

Non-data files do not follow these conventions.

4.2 DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
