# Voyager Magnetometer (MAG)

The Voyager Magnetometer Experiment (MAG) is one of ten experiments carried
onboard the two Voyager spacecraft. Voyager MAG consists of two low field
magnetometers and two high field magnetometers that together provide
measurement of fields from 0.02 nT to 2,000,000 nT (20 G). The Voyager
magnetometers were built at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center ([GSFC](//www.nasa.gov/goddard))
where the project resides. The magnetometers provide direct field measurement
of both the planetary and the interplanetary plasma media. Having completed
their exploration of the outer planets, the Voyager magnetometers are now a
key component of the [ Voyager Interstellar
Mission](//voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/interstellar.html), collecting
measurements of magnetic fields far from the Sun. Research efforts continue as
the two Voyagers fly on towards the heliopause and the interstellar media that
lays beyond.
