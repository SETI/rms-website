## Overview

![]({{ site.assets_url }}voyager/lecp/lecp.gif)

The Voyager Low-Energy Charged Particle Detector (LECP) looks for particles of higher energy than the PLS, and it overlaps
with the Cosmic Ray Subsystem (CRS). It has the broadest energy range of the
three sets of particle sensors.

The LECP can be imagined as a piece of wood, with the particles of interest
playing the role of bullets. The faster a bullet moves, the deeper it will
penetrate the wood. Thus, the depth of penetration measures the speed of the
particles. The number of "bullet holes" over time indicates how many particles
there are in various places in the solar wind, and at the various outer
planets. The orientation of the wood indicates the direction from which the
particles came.
