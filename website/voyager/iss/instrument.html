## Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS)

The Voyager 1 and 2 spacecrafts each carried two cameras, wide-angle and
narrow-angle. An index to the complete technical description of each camera is
provided here.

## Calibration Notes
{: #calib }

The standard, published reference for how to calibrate the Voyager images is
[Danielson et al. 1981](//ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981JGR....86.8683D){:target="_blank"}:

Danielson, G. E., P. N. Kupferman, T. V. Johnson, and L. A. Soderblom 1981.
Radiometric Performance of the Voyager Cameras. _Journal of Geophysical
Research_, **86**, 8683-8689.

It describes the image calibration as understood following the Jupiter
encounters.

The [Voyager Imaginig Science Subsystem Calibration
Report]({{ assets_url }}Benesh_Jepsen_1978.pdf){:target="_blank"}: Benesh and Jepsen, 1978, is now available for
general use. It was produced as a JPL document and compiles the results of
calibrations and tests performed on the ISS cameras.

Additional memos were distributed to the ISS team prior to the Uranus and
Neptune encounters. They have been transcribed here.

[ T. V. Johnson, January 16, 1986](memo_1986_01_16.html){:target="_blank"}: (just before the
Uranus encounter).  [Plain text]({{ assets_url }}memo_1986_01_16.txt){:target="_blank"} version and separate
[figure]({{ assets_url }}figure_1986_01_16.gif){:target="_blank"}.

[ T. V. Johnson, August 18, 1989](memo_1989_08_18.html){:target="_blank"} (just before the
Neptune encounter).  [Plain text]({{ assets_url }}memo_1989_08_18.txt){:target="_blank"} version.

[ G. E. Danielson, May 14, 1990](memo_1990_05_14.html){:target="_blank"} (final post-Neptune
calibration memo).  [Plain text]({{ assets_url }}memo_1990_05_14.txt){:target="_blank"} version.

Note that these subsequent memos only refer to the Voyager 2 instrument. No
re-calibration of the Voyager 1 cameras was ever performed. Nevertheless, it
is widely believed that these calibration correction factors are probably
reasonable for Voyager 1 images as well.

Plots and information about the various filters, based on the work of
[Danielson et al. 1981](//ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981JGR....86.8683D){:target="_blank"}, can be found here.
