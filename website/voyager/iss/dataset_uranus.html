## Data Set Overview
{: #overview}

This Voyager 2 Uranus data set is available on CD-ROM and magnetic tape.

NASA's Voyager Project and the Planetary Data System (PDS) have created an
archive of planetary digital images acquired by the twin Voyager spacecraft
(Voyager 1 and Voyager 2). This Voyager data set encompasses Experiment Data
Record (EDR) files from the Uranus encounter.

The information covers Voyager 2 at Uranus including the planet, its
satellites and rings. Important to note is the fact that while geometry
information and calibration exists for all these data sets, they exist in the
EDR data set, but both of which are available separately through the PDS-JPL
Image Node. Neither does the data set include starfields, calibrations, Plasma
Radio Astronomy (PRA) or Plasma Wave Spectrometer (PWS) image-formatted
information. These too are available separately through the Imaging Node.

This data set exists on magnetic tapes in EDR format (this format is explained
in the 'Multimission Image Processing Laboratory (MIPL) Real-Time Processing
Subsystem Software Design Document (1985)'), an internal JPL document
available through JPL vellum files or by contacting the Imaging Node. The set
of images on the magnetic tapes are raw; no processing has been performed
other than organizing the original telemetry into raster-formatted files.

In addition to the images, supplemental information exists on the CD-ROMs.
This includes documentation about the organization and contents of the disk.
Software source code is included to provide programmers with tools to process
the image files. There are browse images, sub-sampled versions of the full-
resolution images which allow users to rapidly view the archive collection
with their interactive display. Finally, there are image index files
containing information about the images stored in the archive.

**Detailed Target Clarification:**

There are two targets which may prove to be confusing for the unfamiliar user;
PLAQUE and CAL LAMPS, both are used as calibration targets. PLAQUE is an image
of a flat piece of metal illuminated by the sun. CAL LAMPS are lamps inside
the camera used for illumination.

The target DARK is a dark current image when the camera mode is BODARK and the
exposure is zero. DARK SKY and SKY are shuttered images, non-zero exposure
looking at dark sky.

SCAT LIGHT images are used to measure how much light is scattered in a
particular direction.

**Definition Clarification:**

Planetodetic latitude of a point on the planet surface is the angle between
the surface normal and the equatorial plane. For a spherical body, the
latitude is incidental to the planetocentric latitude.

The p5 point is one of 6 static points on all images. It is the point located
in the center of the image. The p1 point is located in the top left corner, p2
top right corner, p3 bottom left corner, p4 bottom right corner, p5 center, p6
center right edge. If the target is not on the p5 point then that point does
not have latitude and longitude coordinates associated with it nor does the
target have a p5 point.

The spacecraft coordinate system is a coordinate system defined by the
spacecraft structure. The antenna points along the +z axis, the booms are
along the +y and -y axes, creating a unique coordinate system for each
spacecraft.

The Canopus coordinate system is the coordinate system defined by one axis
pointing at Canopus, one pointing at the Sun and one pointing somewhere else.

These systems are not used for describing images or points on images. Because
our interest is in where the pixels lie, not relative to the spacecraft or
stars but relative to the target's own system.

## Confidence Level Note
{: #confidence}

This data set represents a complete collection of raw images from Voyager 2
Uranus encounter beginning with the Observatory Phase. To make full scientific
use of the image collection, it is necessary to obtain (from the Imaging Node)
and understand the radiometric and geometric properties of the camera system
and perform corrections to the data. Geometry and basic pointing information
is included for all Image Observation Types including Calibration, Stars and
very small Satellites (or 'Rocks'). Non primary planetary bodies, like rocks
may have geometry that refers to the primary planetary body (URANUS, ARIEL,
UMBRIEL, TITANIA, OBERON, and MIRANDA)

We recommend obtaining a copy of the 'Software Interface Specification, ISS PI
SEDR Processor, Rev.b, SIS 4-7008-2', an internal JPL document available from
JPL vellum files, for reference while using this data set. This document will
clarify some questions which may arise when using the geometry data,
particularly for non primary planetary bodies. For example; the original
predict Supplemental Experiment Data Records (SEDRs) had a target for each
image. Some targets have been changed as information about that particular
image has been refined. However the geometry still refers to the original
target from the SEDR. We suggest contacting the Imaging Node for more
information, clarification or assistance.

The values for emissions and incidence angles contain errors and were received
that way on the original set of SEDR tapes. We intend to update these values
when the entire set of SEDR tapes are regenerated.

While using more than one Voyager data set some confusion can occur due to
duplications in the Flight Data System (FDS) counts (a.k.a. spacecraft clock
times). This is due first to the fact that Voyager 1 and 2 flew concurrently,
so there is inter-spacecraft duplication, and second because of spacecraft
clock resets and rollovers that occurred, causing duplication within data
sets. Users are cautioned therefore, that the FDS count is not a unique
identifier for an image. A unique query must include the spacecraft ID, the
FDS count, and the target.

There are two targets which may prove to be confusing for the unfamiliar user;
PLAQUE and CAL LAMPS, both are used as calibration targets. PLAQUE is an image
of a flat piece of metal illuminated by the sun. CAL LAMPS are lamps inside
the camera used for illumination.

The target DARK is a dark current image when the camera mode is in bodark and
the exposure is zero. SKY is a shuttered image, non zero exposure looking at
dark sky.
