# 1\. Introduction

NASA's Voyager Project and Planetary Data System (PDS) have created an archive
of planetary digital images acquired by the twin Voyager spacecraft. Compact
Disk Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM) is the archival medium used for distribution to
interested scientific research organizations and libraries.

Each CD-ROM volume contains approximately 2500 images stored in individual
compressed files. In addition to the images, supplemental information exists
on the CD-ROMs. This includes documentation providing a user with information
about the organization and contents of the disk. Software source code is
included to provide programmers with tools to process the image files. There
are Browse images, sub-sampled versions of the full-resolution images, which
allow users to rapidly view the archive collection with their interactive
display. Finally, there are Image Index Files containing information about all
the images stored in the archive.

This document describes the organization of the archive. It provides
information on how to access files stored on a CD-ROM, and gives details on
the format and contents of the image files and their supporting supplemental
files.

# 2\. Voyager Images

There are two cameras onboard each Voyager spacecraft, one with a wide field
of view and the other with a narrow field of view. Both cameras return data in
a digital raster-format containing 800 scan lines and 800 samples per scan
line. Each picture element (pixel) in the two dimensional image array is
represented as an 8-bit value, and the value--in the range 0 to 255--is
proportional to the amount of light detected at that point. The cameras are
equipped with color filters so images taken through complementary filters can
be combined during ground processing to produce color images.

The set of images on the CD-ROMs are raw; no processing has been performed
other than organizing the original telemetry into raster-formatted files and
compressing the image data using a Huffman encoding algorithm. The reason for
the decision to distribute raw data rather than processed versions of the
images is that the capabilities to process the raw images are continuing to
improve. This is due to rapid improvements, not only in the techniques
themselves, but also in calibration data and geometric information concerning
spacecraft position and pointing. By providing the raw images which never
change rather than processed versions, the continually improving image
processing capabilities can be reapplied to the raw image collection.

To make full scientific use of the image collection, it is necessary to
understand the radiometric and geometric properties of the camera system (6)
and perform corrections to the data. A number of image processing systems are
available which provide radiometric and geometric corrections, display
capabilities, and analysis tools for Voyager images (7, 8).

# 3\. Voyager Image Files

## 3.1 Compressed Format

Full-resolution Voyager images are stored in a compressed format using a
Huffman encoding scheme. The great advantage of Huffman encoding is the
significant reduction in disk space required to store an image while
maintaining full data precision. The average Voyager image is compressed by a
factor of more than three. Using this technique, more than 2400 compressed
images can be stored on a single CD-ROM rather than 800 in an uncompressed
format.

There is a price to pay when storing data in a compressed format. It takes
computer time to decompress an image to its original uncompressed form. For
example, on a VAX-750 it takes about one minute of CPU time to decompress an
image. The one minute time delay for decompressing an image can be frustrating
when a planetary scientist wants to browse an image collection.

## 3.2 Browse Format

A special set of image files were created to facilitate rapid browse of the
collection. These files exist in an uncompressed format and have been reduced
in size by sub-sampling the 800 line and 800 sample images. A Browse image,
containing 200 lines and samples, has been sub-sampled by a factor of four in
the line and sample directions. The data volume of a Browse image is 1/16th of
the original image size. The small size of a Browse image in an uncompressed
format allows images to be rapidly retrieved from a CD-ROM and displayed on a
screen.

## 3.3 File Naming Conventions

Each digital image file has a unique name constructed from the clock count of
Voyager's Flight Data Subsystem (FDS). The FDS count indicates the time at
which an image was shuttered. The general form of an image file name is
Cxxxxxxx.yyy. The character 'C' at the beginning of the file name designates
the 'xxxxxxx' as a clock count. The 'xxxxxxx' is the seven digit FDS count
associated with the image. The file name extension, designated as 'yyy',
specifies the type of image file. Full-resolution compressed files have the
file name extension IMQ. Sub-sampled Browse images have the file name
extension IBG. For example, the file name C1574959.IMQ is a full-resolution
compressed image acquired when the FDS clock count was 1574959.

# 4\. Disk Directory Structure

The volume and directory structure of the CD-ROM conforms to the level-1
standard specified by the International Standards Organization (ISO). The ISO
standard was used so that the disks can be accessed on a wide variety of
computer systems. Information on the ISO is provided in Appendix A.

The compressed and Browse image files, supplemental files, documentation, and
software source code are separated into disk directories. Four directories are
common to all Voyager image CD-ROMs: the DOCUMENT directory contains the
documentation file associated with the archive; the SOFTWARE directory
contains software for decompressing an image file; the INDEX directory
contains an Image Index File; and the LABEL directory contains labels coded in
the Object Description Language that describe the format and content of
engineering data included with each image.

The full-resolution compressed image files are subdivided into directories
based on the image's target. Targets generally include the primary body
(planet), satellites, and rings. There is a directory associated with each
target for which there are images on a disk. For example, images of Io are
contained under a directory named IO. These subdirectories have names of the
form CnnnnXXX, where 'nnnn' is the first four digits of the FDS count (unique
picture identifier) of the image files contained in the subdirectory. For
example, the subdirectory C1574XXX under the JUPITER directory would contain
all of the Jupiter images which fall in the range C1574000.IMQ to
C1574959.IMQ.

Image files related to camera calibration sequences are stored in the CALIB
directory. Dark current images, acquired when an image is taken with the
camera shutter closed, are found in the DARK subdirectory. The PLAQUE
subdirectory includes calibration plaque images, obtained when Voyager's
calibration plaque is positioned in front of a camera's field of view. The
internal calibration lamp data, acquired when the camera shutter is closed and
the internal lamps are turned on, are found in the CALLAMPS subdirectory.

Included in the OTHER directory are images of stars and other non-planetary
targets.

A special directory exists to hold frames which should not be confused with
raw data. Frames in this RESTORED directory have been reconstructed from
processed versions of the raw data because the raw data itself is lost. The
reconstruction process attempts to recreate a dynamic range very close to that
of the raw data, but the pixels do not contain raw data. The compressed
reconstructed images are named with the extension .IRQ, whereas the Browse
versions reside with the rest of the Browse images and have the standard .IBG
extension.

The sub-sampled Browse versions of the image collection are located in the
BROWSE directory area. This directory maintains the same tree structure
associated with the full-resolution images. The subdirectories within the
BROWSE directory separate the images by their target, and certain target
directories containing numerous images are further subdivided. As an example,
the subdirectory C1574XXX within the JUPITER subdirectory of the BROWSE
directory contains all of the Browse images of Jupiter which fall in the range
C1574000.IBG to C1574959.IBG.

# 5\. Image Files in Compressed Format

## 5.1 First-Difference Huffman Encoding

The full-resolution images on the CD-ROMs are stored in a compressed format.
The scheme is called a first-difference, Huffman code procedure. The first-
difference technique subtracts each sample value from the previous sample
along a line. The process, resulting in a set of values for each line which
clusters around zero, eliminates the pixel-to-pixel correlation along an image
line. The Huffman coding technique then creates varying length bit strings to
represent each first-difference value. The most frequently occurring values
will consist of very short bit strings, and the less frequently occurring
values will consist of longer bit strings. The combined compression algorithm
provides a technique which is simple, has minimum overhead, and allows exact
restoration. References to Huffman coding can be found in most books dealing
with data compression (9).

A Huffman coding tree is individually created for each image in order to
produce the most efficient compression. In order to create an individual
coding tree, a first-difference histogram is created for the image. This is
done on a line by line basis. The first pixel of each line is left fixed
(neither differenced nor compressed). Each succeeding pixel is subtracted from
the true value of the preceding pixel. The count for each possible difference
is kept in an encoding histogram table and stored in the image file. There can
be a total of 511 first-difference values. The least first-difference value is
0 - 255 or -255, while the largest first-difference value is 255 - 0 or 255.
The first-difference values are normalized for table use to the range 1 to 511
by adding 256 to each difference.

The Huffman code tree is generated from the first-difference histogram table.
The first-difference values become the leaves of a tree. At each step in the
generation of the tree the currently active tree nodes are ordered by
frequency and the two nodes with smallest count are combined to form a new
node. The new node is added to the active list while the combining nodes are
dropped. The count of the new node is the sum of the counts of the combining
nodes. This is continued until there is only one resulting active node. Each
branch of a branching node is assigned a value of 0 or 1. The Huffman code
corresponding to a leaf node value is determined by tracing the branches of
the tree from the root to the leaf node. A brief example follows.

    
    

                     Example Huffman Encoding Tree

                            15 !-----! 1
     1111110  5   -4  ---! 0   !
                      10 !-----! 1
     1111111  5    4  ---! 1
    

There are essentially two steps in the decompression of an image. First, the
first-difference histogram is extracted from the image file. The histogram is
given to an initialization routine which sets up the Huffman coding tree for
decompression. Second, the compressed lines are read from the image file and
passed, one at a time, to the decompression routine for restoration to the
original line.

In the restoration of a compressed line, the decompression routine takes each
bit from the input stream and determines which branch to take in a path from
the root to the leaf nodes. Once a leaf node is reached, the undifferenced
value of the pixel can be computed from the leaf node value and the previous
pixel. The search is reset to start from the root on the next input bit and
the process continues for the whole line.

## 5.2 Decompression Software

Computer software, available as source code, resides on each CD-ROM for
decompressing a compressed image. This software can be found in the SOFTWARE
directory. In order to make the software useful to a wide community of users,
versions of the decompression software are provided in FORTRAN, C-language,
and VAX/VMS assembler language. Some modification of these routines may be
required in order to adapt the software to a particular computer and operating
system environment. The SOFTWARE directory contains a file named SOFTINFO.TXT
which briefly describes the contents of the directory. The subdirectories MAC,
PC, VAX and UNIX contain detailed software descriptions in text files.

The decompression subroutines are designed to be tools for an application
program. Typically, an application program will open an image file, read the
image data from the file, call the decompression routines to restore the
image, and then transfer the image to the appropriate output media or display
device. Because of differences between computer hardware, operating systems,
and in-house image processing systems, no attempt has been made to provide
generalized software for accessing an image from the CD-ROM and restoring it
to a hardware display device or an in-house image file format. Example
programs are however provided in the software directories which test and
demonstrate the use of the decompression software.

The software has two top-level subroutines, DECMPINIT and DECOMPRESS. They
provide a common data base from which to call the processing routines.
DECMPINIT builds the Huffman tree from the first-difference histogram, also
called the encoding histogram, and is called only once per image. DECOMPRESS
processes one compressed input line per call and returns the line completely
restored. These routines are fully documented. Consult the source code files
in the software directories for a full explanation of their use.

A cautionary note is in order. The first-difference histogram stored in the
image files consist of 32-bit VAX integers (11). Users of other computer
hardware environments may need to swap integer byte pairs.

# 6\. Compressed Image File Organization

A compressed image file is composed of variable-length records defined
according to the ISO standard. Each variable-length record starts with a
record length indicator, stored as a 16-bit integer, followed by the number of
bytes indicated in the record length indicator. If the length indicator is
odd, then a pad byte is appended to the end of the record so that all records
contain an even number of bytes. Refer to the information on variable-length
records in Appendix A. Variable-length record files were chosen because of the
nature of the compressed images; compressed lines, represented as individual
records, will vary in length from one to another.

Compressed image files begin with a label area. Following the label area are
the file objects: Image Histogram, Encoding Histogram, Engineering Table, and
Image. The sections which follow provide a description of the image labels and
the data objects within the file.

[Back to the index](#index)

## 6.1 Image Label Area

Descriptive information on the file and objects within the file is put into
the label area. The label consists of keyword statements which conform to
version 1.0 of the Object Description Language (ODL) under development by the
PDS project (10). There are three types of ODL statements within a label:
structural statements, keyword assignment statements, and pointer statements.

Structural statements provide a shell around value assignment statements that
delineate which data object the assignment statements are describing.

The structural statements are:

    
    

              1) OBJECT = object_name
              2) END_OBJECT
              3) END
    

The OBJECT statement begins a description of a particular data object and the
END_OBJECT statement signals the end of the object's description. All
assignment statements between an OBJECT and its corresponding END_OBJECT
statement describe the particular object named in the OBJECT statement. The
END statement terminates a label. It must appear as a single line that
contains only the word END.

A keyword assignment statement contains the name of an attribute and the value
of that attribute for the object which the assignment statement is describing.
Keyword assignment statements have the following format:

    
    

          name = value [/* comment */]
    

Values of keyword assignment statements can be numeric values, literals, and
text strings. Appendix B contains the syntactic rules for keyword assignments.

Pointer statements are a special class of keyword assignment statements. These
pointers are expressed in the ODL using the following notation:

    
    

          ^object_name = location
    

In a file, the location is given as an integer representing the starting
record number of the object, measured from the beginning of the file. The
first record in a file is considered record 1. Pointers are also useful for
describing the location of individual components of a data object and for
pointing to a detached label. An example of the later is shown below:

    
    

          ^object_STRUCTURE = 'logical_file_name'
    

The 'object' is the name of the object being described and 'logical_file_name'
is the name of the detached label file containing the description.

In a compressed image file, each keyword assignment in the label area is
stored as a single variable-length record. An example of the keyword labels
which exist on a compressed image is shown below. Appendix C provides a
detailed description of each keyword found in the example.

## 6.2 Image Histogram Object

The first object in a compressed image file is the histogram of the image. The
Histogram Object begins at the record specified by the ^IMAGE_HISTOGRAM
keyword. The histogram is made up of two variable-length records. (The number
of records found in an object is determined by differencing the value of the
pointer keyword from the value of the next pointer. For example, the value of
^ENDCODING_HISTOGRAM minus the value of the ^IMAGE_HISTOGRAM equals the value
2.) These two records, when concatenated together, make up 256 items in the
image histogram. Each item is a 32-bit VAX integer (11). The first element of
the histogram contains the frequency of occurrences for the pixel value of 0,
the last element contains the frequency for the pixel value 255.

## 6.3 Encoding Histogram Object

The second object in a compressed image file is the Encoding Histogram used to
generate the Huffman coding table. The Encoding Histogram Object begins at the
record specified by the ^ENCODING_HISTOGRAM keyword. The Encoding Histogram is
made up of three variable-length records (^ENCODING_HISTOGRAM -
^ENGINEERING_TABLE). These three records, when concatenated together, make up
511 items with each item a 32-bit VAX integer (11). The first element of the
histogram contains the frequency of occurrences for the first-difference value
of -255. The last element contains the frequency for the value 255. Software
will need to read the Encoding Histogram from the Encoding Histogram Object,
and then pass it to the DECMPINIT subroutine for initialization.

## 6.4 Engineering Table Object

The third object in a compressed image file is the Engineering Table. The
table starts at the record specified by the ^ENGINEERING_TABLE keyword. The
table is made up of a single variable-length record. The table contains
supplemental engineering data which typically will not be used by most image
processing users. Information in this object includes the FDS counts at start
and end of image acquisition, system noise levels, synchronization error
counts, engineering status, subcommand loads, and other engineering
information. A description of the Engineering Table Object can be found in
Appendix E. The file ENGTAB.LBL in the LABEL directory provides an ODL label
describing the engineering table.

[Back to the index](#index)

## 6.5 Image Object

The fourth object in a compressed image file contains the image data. The
image starts at the record specified by the ^IMAGE keyword. The image is made
up of 800 variable-length records; each record represents a single line.

For Voyager images in an uncompressed form , there are 800 lines and 800
samples per line. Each record has 36 Suffix Bytes appended to the end of each
line record. Each sample is an 8-bit unsigned integer. The keywords in the
label area that describe the image are the LINES, LINE_SAMPLES,
LINE_SUFFIX_BYTES, SAMPLE_BITS, and SAMPLE_TYPE keywords. For more information
on these keywords see Appendix C.

The compressed lines are different lengths because the decompression factor
for each line is different. The image samples and the Line Suffix Bytes are
both in a compressed form. The first byte of a compressed line is the actual
value of the first sample in the line. The rest of the record is the Huffman
coded bits of the first-difference values. In order to reconstruct an image
line, the compressed line must be passed to the DECOMPRESS subroutine.

The Suffix Bytes in the line record contain line engineering data. The format,
after decompression, are described in Appendix D. The file LINESUFX.LBL in the
LABEL directory provides an ODL label describing the line suffix after
decompression.

# 7\. Browse Image File Organization

The format of Browse image files differs from that of the compressed image
files. The primary difference is the record structure of the files. Browse
images are stored as direct-access files with fixed-length records as defined
by the ISO CD-ROM standard (12). Refer to the information on fixed-length
record files in Appendix A. Fixed-length record files are appropriate for
Browse images because the image lines, represented as individual records, are
fixed in size. The length of each fixed-length record, specified by the
RECORD_BYTES keyword, is 200 bytes. Fixed-length record files have the added
advantage of providing direct-access to any part of the file making it
unnecessary to sequentially pass though a file to reach a particular record.
This is the preferred data storage technique for many image processing systems
(7, 8).

Browse image files, internally similar to the organization of compressed image
files, begin with a label area followed by the file objects: Image Histogram,
and Image. The Encoding Histogram Object, not required because the image is
not compressed, and the Engineering Table object do not exist in Browse image
files. Also, there are no Line Suffix Bytes present. The sections which follow
provide a description of the image labels and the data objects within the
file.

[Back to the index](#index)

## 7.1 Image Label Area

Browse image labels are similar to those for compressed files; they contain
the same keyword syntax and keyword assignment statements. The chief
difference between the Browse image labels and the compressed labels are how
they are stored in the records. Unlike compressed image files, keyword
assignment statements are not stored in individual records. Instead, a file
record will contain several keyword statements. The label records, when
concatenated together, consist of a contiguous string of characters. The
keywords are then extracted from this string. The keywords are separated from
one another by a carriage-return and line-feed character sequence. An example
of the keyword labels existing on a Browse image is shown below. Appendix C
provides a detailed description of each keyword found in the example.

## 7.2 Image Histogram Object

The first object in the file, the image histogram, begins at the record
specified by the ^IMAGE_HISTOGRAM keyword. The histogram is make up of six
fixed-length records and is otherwise constructed identically to the
compressed file Image Histogram Object. (Remember, the length of an object, in
records, is determined by differencing the value of the pointer keyword from
the value of the next pointer. For example, the value of ^IMAGE_HISTOGRAM
minus the value of the ^IMAGE equals the value 6.)

The six records, when concatenated together, contain the 256 elements of the
image histogram. (The keyword ITEMS specifies the number of items in the
object.) The image histogram will occupy the first 1024 bytes of the 1200
bytes which make up the six concatenated records. The remaining 176 bytes at
the end of the Image Histogram Object are to be ignored.

[Back to the index](#index)

## 7.3 Image Object

The Image Object starts at the record specified by the ^IMAGE keyword. The
image is made up of 200 fixed-length records where each record represents a
single image line.

The keywords found in the IMAGE object describe the image area. There are 200
lines (LINES keyword), and 200 samples in a line (LINE_SAMPLES keyword).
Unlike standard image files, there are no Line Suffix Bytes so the
LINE_SUFFIX_BYTES keyword is not found in the label. Each sample is an 8-bit
unsigned integer (SAMPLE_BITS and SAMPLE_TYPE keywords).

# 8\. Image Index File

The Image Index File, named IMGINDEX.TAB and located in the INDEX directory,
contains basic information about the image files located on the volume.
Included in the image index is information on the camera state, exposure time,
image target, optical filter, and other camera parameters. A description of
the record fields and format is found in Appendix F. The Image Index File
consists of fixed-length records of length 512 bytes in ASCII character
representation. Each record contains the information for one image.

There is a label file, IMGINDEX.LBL, located in the INDEX directory. which
describes the contents of the index file. The label file consists of keyword
statements in the Object Description Language (ODL) developed by the PDS
project (10).

# Appendix A - ISO Volume and Directory Standard

The volume and directory structure of the CD-ROM conforms to the standard
specified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) (12).
The ISO standard has three levels of interchange. The CD-ROM disk conforms to
the first level of interchange, level-1. This level allows file attributes and
characteristics to be specified in an extended attribute record.

For computer operating systems which support the capabilities of the full
level-1 ISO standard, access to the CD-ROM volume will be straightforward; all
of the operating system capabilities for I/O will operate on the disk. For
example, it will be possible to obtain directory listings, copy files, and
utilize high level I/O functions. For computer systems which do not support
the ISO standard, access to the image files will be more difficult; special
operating system input/output routines will need to be developed or obtained
in order to access the files.

Because the disk is produced at the level-1 ISO standard, files will be
prefixed with an extended attribute record. The extended attribute record
contains information about a file's record format, record attributes, and
record length. This information is utilized by computer systems which support
the full level-1 structure. The extended attribute record is not considered
part of the file and is not seen by programs accessing a file with high-level
I/O routines.

For computer systems that do not support extended attribute records of the ISO
standard, the extended attribute record is considered part of a file. The
extended attribute record will be located in the first 2048 bytes of the file
and should be bypassed by the I/O routines which access the data.

## A.1 Variable-Length Records

Variable-length record files contain records with any number of bytes, up to a
specified maximum. These records are prefixed by a count field, indicating the
number of bytes in the record. The count field comprises two bytes on a CD-ROM
stored in a VAX integer format (11). The value stored in the count field
indicates the number of data bytes in the record.

Variable-length record files can only be accessed sequentially. This means
file I/O routines start reading a file with the first record; subsequent reads
provide the next sequential record in the file.

In the ISO standard, an odd valued record length can be specified but the
actual record length must be even. If an odd-length record is specified, the
value stored in the count field will contain the odd length. However, the
record will be padded at the end of the record with a zero-filled byte to make
the actual record length even.

For computer systems supporting variable-length records there will be high-
level I/O routines to access the file. For systems which do not support the
level-1 ISO standard or do not support variable-length records, software will
need to be developed for handling these files.

## A.2 Direct Access Files

Direct-access files with fixed-length records have implied records; there is
no information in the file designating the start or end of a record. Rather,
the first byte of a record within a file starts at a fixed offset byte
position from the start of the file. Direct-access files allow any part of a
file to be accessed directly without the need to sequentially pass through a
file. To determine the record byte-offset position, the following calculation
can be made:

    
    

                 off = (rec-1)*len
          where: off = offset byte position of record from start of file
                 rec = desired record to access
                 len = length of record in bytes

# Appendix B - Syntactic Rules of Keyword Entries

A keyword/value assignment, made up of a string of ASCII characters, contains
the name of one parameter and the value of that parameter. A keyword entry has
the general form shown below:

    
    

                   name  = value  [/* comment */]
    

The layout of each keyword entry is essentially free-form; blanks and tabs are
typically ignored by a parsing routine. A keyword parameter name is separated
from the keyword value by the equal symbol (=). Each keyword entry may
optionally be followed by a comment that more completely describes the entry.
The comment begins with a slash character followed by an asterisk character
(/*), and terminates with an asterisk character followed by a slash character
(*/). Comments may exist on a line without a keyword entry.

Values associated with a keyword represent integers, real numbers, unitized
real numbers, literals, time, or character text strings.

## B.1 Integer Numbers

An integer value consists of a string of decimal digits preceded optionally by
a sign (+ or -). Non-decimal based integers are expressed according to the Ada
language convention: b#nnnnnnn#, where 'b' represents the base of the number,
and '#' delimits the number 'nnnnnnnn'. As an example, the number expressed as
2#111# represents the binary number 111 (7 in base 10).

[Back to the index](#index)

## B.2 Real Numbers

A real number has the form: [s]f.d[En] where

    
    

           s = optional sign (+ or -)
           f = one or more decimal digits that specify the integral
               portion of the number.
           d = one or more decimal digits that specify the fraction
               portion of the number.
           n = an optional exponent expressed as a power of 10.
    

A unitized real number is a real number with a unit of measurement associated
with the number. The units are enclosed in angle brackets (< >). As an
example, 1.234  indicates the measurement 1.234 seconds.

[Back to the index](#index)

## B.3 Time

A special form of a numeric field is the TIME value, the following format of
date/time representation is used:

    
    

            yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.fffZ
    

where:

    
    

            yyyy    = year
            mm      = month
            dd      = day of month
            hh      = hour
            mm      = minute
            ss      = seconds
            fff     = fraction of a second
            Z       = The Z qualifier indicates the time is expressed
                      as universal time corrected.
    

[Back to the index](#index)

## B.4 Literal Values

A literal value is typically a member of a set of finite values. It is a
string constructed from letters (A-Z), decimal digits (0-9), and the
underscore character (_). The first character must be a letter. Optionally, a
literal value may be delimited by single-quote (') characters. If a literal
appears within single-quotes, the literal may contain any printable ASCII
character. For example, the literal value '1:1' is legal as long as the
single-quoted format is used. A keyword construction using a literal value
might look like the example shown below:

    
    

                    FILTER_NAME = BLUE
    

In this example the statement says the BLUE filter of the camera was used to
acquire an image.

[Back to the index](#index)

## B.5 Text Character Strings

Text strings can be any length and can consist of any sequence of printable
ASCII characters, tabs, blanks, carriage-control, or line-feed characters
enclosed in double-quote characters. The string continues until a double-quote
character is encountered.

# Appendix C - Keyword Assignments For Images

    
    

    CCSD3ZF0000100000001NJPL3IF0PDS200000001 = SFDU_LABEL
    

This keyword provides a mechanism for image files to conform to the SFDU
(Standard Formatted Data Unit) convention. The first 40 bytes of each file
contain the SFDU. The SFDU label associated with a PDS image file consists of
a 20 byte universal SFDU identifier indicating the type of SFDU and that end-
of-file delimitation is being used. The second 20 bytes identifies the JPL
control authority, and that the PDS2 data definition language is used to
describe the data product. The value 'SFDU_LABEL' is added for compatibility
with keyword/value parsers.

    
    

    RECORD_TYPE = FIXED_LENGTH or VARIABLE_LENGTH
    

This keyword defines the record structure of the file. Compressed files have
VARIABLE_LENGTH records and Browse image files have FIXED_LENGTH records.

    
    

    RECORD_BYTES = xxxx

indicates before and a + sign indicates after closest planetary approach.
'ddd' = number of days from closest approach.

    
    

    IMAGE_NUMBER = xxxxx.xx
    

Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) clock count at time of image acquisition. There is
a unique IMAGE_NUMBER for each image in a planetary encounter. The clock count
is always a seven digit value, five digits to the left of the decimal point
and two digits to the right of the decimal point.

    
    

    IMAGE_TIME = yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ
    

Time at which image was acquired, the time system is Universal Time Corrected.
'yyyy' = year, 'mm' = month, 'dd' = day of month, 'hh' = hour, 'mm' = minute,

This keyword sequence identifies the Image Histogram Object. The object
contains 256 elements, stored in VAX integer format (11), and has 32 bits for
each element. The records associated with an object are thought of as being
concatenated together when making up the object. Some objects will not
completely fill the records which make up the object. For example, in the
Image Histogram Object for Browse images there are six fixed-length records of
200 bytes per record. The image histogram will occupy the first 1024 bytes of
the 1200 bytes which make up the six records. The remaining 176 bytes at the
end of the Image Histogram Object are to be ignored.

# Appendix D - Supplemental Line Engineering Data

The table shown below describes the information contained in an image line
record for full-resolution images. The supplemental line engineering data is
found in byte positions 801 through 836 of the line record. Both the image
data and the supplemental line engineering data are in a compressed form in
the file and are decompressed for restoration. The byte positions reference
the line record after decompression. All integer values are stored in VAX
integer format (11).

In the table the first byte in the record is designated byte 1. The bit
positions of a byte are numbered as bit 0 for the least significant bit and
bit 7 as the most significant bit.

# Appendix F - Image Index File Format

The Image Index File contains information about the image files located on the
CD-ROM volumes. Included in the image index is information on the camera
state, exposure time, image target, optical filter, and other camera
parameters. The Image Index File consists of fixed-length records of length
512 bytes in ASCII character representation. Each record contains the
information for a single image.

The table shown below describes the contents of the Image Index File, named
IMGINDEX.TAB. This file is located in the INDEX directory. All fields are in
ASCII character format. The Image Index File was formatted to allow automatic
data entry programs to access the data for entry into an existing data base
system. The non-numeric fields in the image index will be enclosed by double-
quote characters. All fields are separated by blank characters. The last two
bytes in a record are a carriage-control and line-feed character. The table
shown below gives the starting and ending byte positions of each field in the
table. These byte positions specify the actual fields and do not include the
double-quote marks and commas which separate the fields.
