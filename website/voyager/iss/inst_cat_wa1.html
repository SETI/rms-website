### Instrument Description
{: #inst_desc }

The Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) is a modified version of the slow
scan vidicon camera designs that were used in the earlier Mariner flights. The
system consists of two cameras, a high resolution Narrow Angle (NA) camera and
a lower resolution, more sensitive Wide Angle (WA) camera. Unlike the other on
board instruments, operation of the cameras is not autonomous, but is
controlled by an imaging parameter table residing in one of the spacecraft
computers, the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) (Voyager Science and Mission
Systems Handbook, 1987, JPL D-498, an internal JPL document available from JPL
vellum files).

The original mission was to Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager surpassed expectations
and Voyager 2 went on to encounter Uranus and Neptune. As the Voyager mission
progressed the objects photographed were further from the sun so they appear
more faint even though longer exposures were used. As the Voyager spacecrafts’
distance from the Earth increases, the telecommunications capability at each
encounter decreases. The difference in capabilities from the Jupiter and
Saturn encounters and that at Uranus and Neptune was considerable. The reduced
telecommunications capability limits the number of data modes that imaging can
use. Because of the diminished brightness of the objects being photographed,
longer exposure times were used, many beyond the stated maximum of 15.360
seconds. Longer exposure times were all 48-second increments added to the
maximum. In addition, the camera was slewed in order to avoid smeared imaging.
The light flood state (on/off) was independent of the instrument mode.

### Science Objectives
{: #sci_obj }

The overall objective of this experiment is exploratory reconnaissance of
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and their satellites and rings. Such
reconnaissance, at resolutions and phase angles unobtainable from Earth,
provides much new data relevant to the atmospheric and/or surface properties
of these bodies. The experiment also has the following specific objectives:
observe and characterize global circulation and meteorology; determine the
horizontal and vertical structure of visible clouds; characterize the nature
of any colored material which may be in clouds.

### Operational Considerations
{: #op_con }

To make full scientific use of the image collection, it is necessary to
understand the radiometric and geometric characteristics of the camera system
and perform corrections to data.

Each Voyager camera is unique in terms of its calibrated characteristics. Each
has intrinsic shading (spatially non-uniform output DNs from flat field
target) and exhibits barrel distortions typical of TV cameras flown on
previous planetary missions. Because of these characteristics, the cameras
were calibrated before launch. The response of the pixels to known targets,
illumination, exposures, etc. was measured and Calibration Files were
generated to remove radiometric and geometric distortions from the flight
images. These Calibration Files and detailed information on their use are
available through the Imaging Node.

### Calibration Description
{: #cal_desc }

The calibration program for the Voyager television cameras consisted of three
parts: (1) component calibrations (‘Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem
Calibration Report’ July 31, 1978, M. Benesh and P. Jepsen, D618-802); (2)
subsystem calibrations; and, (3) system calibrations. In addition, provision
was made for in-flight calibrations. Component calibrations were carried out
prior to camera assembly. Important measurements include spectral
transmittance of the lens and filters, actual exposure times and shading
characteristics of the shutter, and pertinent electro-optical properties of
the vidicon. After the optics and sensor were assembled it was possible to run
calibrations at the camera, or subsystem, level. Particular activities
accomplished during this period included radiometric calibrations, focal
length measurement, determination of the modulation transfer function,
measurement of the geometric distortion, and calibrations required for color
reconstruction. System calibrations were conducted after the cameras were
installed on the spacecraft. Important tasks included measurement of the
Field-Of-View alignment and verification of the flat-field light transfer
characteristics. Noise measurements were also made at the system level.

A method for in-flight calibration was also available. It consisted of a flat
reflective surface which is located about 2 m from the camera. A flat-field
light transfer curve can be constructed by orienting the spacecraft so that
the plaque is illuminated by the sun and by photographing it at the proper
exposure times.

However, calibration data was collected but no new calibration files were
generated during the Jupiter, Saturn, or Uranus encounters or their related
cruise periods.

Although the INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER_NAME has been provided as Radiance, the
Voyager Experiment Data Record (EDR) data set has not been radiometrically
corrected, and thus images do not represent radiance units. In order to
convert an image from Data Number (DN) to radiance units, the image must be
calibrated. Radiometric calibration files, and selected radiometrically
corrected images are available through the Imaging Node.

<pre><code>      Detector Type                  : VIDICON

      Nominal Operating Temperature  : 282.000000
</code></pre>

The sensor used in the Voyager Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) camera system
is a 25-mm diameter magnetic deflection vidicon (number B41-003, General
Electro-dynamics Co.). The vidicon storage surface (target) is selenium
sulphur and can store a high resolution (1500 TV lines) picture for over 100 s
at room temperature. The active image area on the target is 11.14 x 11.14 mm.
Each frame consists of 800 lines with 800 picture elements (pixels) per line,
i.e., 1 pixel =14 microns. One frame requires 48 s for electronic readout. In
addition to the normal frame readout of 48 s (1:1), four extended frame-time
modes of 2:1, 3:1, 5:1, and 10:1 are available by command. Following readout,
light flooding is used to remove any residual image that might remain from the
previous frame. At the end of light flooding, 14 erase frames are used to
stabilize and prepare the vidicon target for the next exposure sequence (VGR
ISS Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL document available from JPL
vellum files).

**Sensitivity**

Calibration experiments show the gain map indicating higher sensitivity toward
the top of the frame in a radial manner. Dark-current ratio results indicate a
mean within plus-or-minus 3% of the true linearity of the light transfer
function. The required accuracy of the light transfer functions was plus-or-
minus 5% of half-scale signal averaged over any randomly selected area of 10
contiguous pixels. This requirement was consistently met for all ISS flight
cameras. The radiance of the used light cannons was supposed to be plus-or-
minus 5% or better of the level to produce a half-scale signal. This criterion
was also met. It is not clear whether the color spatial dependence is due to
the vidicon, or whether the filters have varying transmissions. In the latter
case, the ratios would be independent of light level; and this has been
observed to be the case for all flight cameras. Moreover, vidicons have not
shown scale variations of this magnitude in the past, so that it is easier to
believe that they are due to the spectral filters rather than to the vidicons.
The color sensitivity is sufficient to require a separate decalibration file
for each spectral filter, which has been done, but not gross enough to cause
concern about the quality of the image itself (VGR ISS Calibration Report,
1978, an internal JPL document available from JPL vellum files).

### Instrument Electronics
{: #inst_elec }

The Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) electronics consist of the vidicon support
circuits and the signal chain. The vidicon support circuits are the vertical
and horizontal sweep circuits, and the various power supplies for the vidicon
filament, and the focus and alignment coils. The signal chain consists of the
analog signal amplifiers, bandpass filters, and an eight bit analog-to-digital
converter. The digital output is sent to the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) for
editing.

### Filters
{: #filters }

Spectral measurements at the manufacturer were taken on Beckman spectro-
photometers, and verifications at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) were made
with a Cary 14 spectro-photometer. Each test scan was run from 2000 to 7000
Angstroms to check for eventual leaks outside the passband (VGR ISS
Calibration Report, 1978, an internal JPL document available from JPL vellum
files). For spectral information on each filter, see Danielson, E. G., et al.
