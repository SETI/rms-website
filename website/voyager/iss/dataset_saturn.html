## Data Set Overview
{: #overview }

This Voyager 1 & 2 Saturn data set is available on CD-ROM.

NASA's Voyager Project and the Planetary Data System (PDS) have created an
archive of planetary digital images acquired by the twin Voyager spacecraft
(Voyager 1 and Voyager 2). This Voyager dataset encompasses a subset of the
Experiment Data Record (EDR) files from the Saturn encounters.

The information covers Voyager 1 and 2 at Saturn (1981), including the planet,
its satellites and rings. Important to note is the fact that while geometry
information and calibration exists for this data set, they do not exist in the
EDR data set, but both are available separately through the Imaging Node.
Neither does the data set include starfields, calibrations, Plasma Radio
Astronomy (PRA) or Plasma Wave Spectrometer (PWS) image-formatted information.
These too are available separately through the Imaging Node.

The complete Voyager 1 & 2 Saturn data set resides on magnetic tape in EDR
format (reference VG1/VG2-S-ISS-2-EDR-V1.0). (No processing has been performed
other than organizing the original telemetry into raster-formatted files. The
set of images on CD-ROM are also raw, however they have been compressed using
a Huffman encoding algorithm.)

**Detail Target Clarification:**

There are two targets which may prove to be confusing for the unfamiliar user;
PLAQUE and CAL LAMPS, both are used as calibration targets. PLAQUE is an image
of a flat piece of metal illuminated by the sun. CAL LAMPS are lamps inside
the camera used for illumination.

The target DARK is a dark current image when the camera mode is BODARK and the
exposure is zero. DARK SKY and SKY are shuttered images, non-zero exposures
looking at dark sky.

SCAT LIGHT images are used to measure how much light is scattered in a
particular direction.

In addition to the images, supplemental information exists on the CD-ROMs.
This includes documentation about the organization and contents of the disk.
Software source code is included to provide programmers with tools to process
the image files. There are browse images, sub-sampled versions of the full-
resolution images, which allow users to rapidly view the archive collection
with their interactive display. Finally, there are image index files
containing information about the images stored in the archive.

**Definition Clarification:**

Planetodetic latitude of a point on the planet surface is the angle between
the surface normal and the equatorial plane. For a spherical body, the
latitude is incidental to the planetocentric latitude.

The p5 point is one of 6 static points on all images. It is the point located
in the center of the image. The p1 point is located in the top left corner, p2
top right corner, p3 bottom left corner, p4 bottom right corner, p5 center, p6
center right edge. If the target is not on the p5 point then tat point does
not have latitude and longitude coordinates associated with it nor does the
target have a p5 point.

The spacecraft coordinate system is a coordinate system defined by the
spacecraft structure. The antenna points along the +z axis, the booms are
along the +y and -y axes, creating a unique coordinate system for each
spacecraft.

The Canopus coordinate system is the coordinate system defined by one axis
pointing at Canopus, one pointing at the Sun and one pointing somewhere else.

These systems are not used for describing images or points on images. Because
our interest is in where the pixels lie, not relative to the spacecraft or
stars but relative to the target's own system.

## Confidence Level Note
{: #confidence}

This data set represents a collection of raw images from Voyager 1 & 2 Saturn
encounters beginning with the Observatory Phase. To make full scientific use
of the image collection, it is necessary to understand and obtain (from the
Imaging Node) the radiometric and geometric properties of the camera system
and perform corrections to the data. Geometry and basic pointing information
is included for all Image Observation Types including Calibration, Stars and
very small Satellites (or 'Rocks'). Non major planetary bodies, like rocks may
have geometry that refers to the primary planetary bodies (SATURN, MIMAS,
ENCELADUS, TETHYS, DIONE, RHEA, TITAN, HYPERION, IAPETUS, and PHOEBE).

We recommend obtaining a copy of the 'Software Interface Specification, ISS PI
SEDR Processor, Rev.b, SIS 4-7008-2', an internal JPL document available from
the JPL vellum files, for reference while using this data set. This document
will clarify some questions which may arise when using the geometry data,
particularly for non primary planetary bodies. For example; the original
predict Supplemental Experiment Data Records (SEDRs) had a target for each
image. Some targets have been changed as information about that particular
image has been refined. However the geometry still refers to the original
target from the SEDR. We suggest contacting the Imaging Node for more
information, clarification or assistance.

The values for emissions and incidence angles contain errors and were received
that way on the original set of SEDR tapes. We intend to update these values
when the entire set of SEDR tapes are regenerated.

While using more than one Voyager data set some confusion can occur due to
duplications in the Flight Data System (FDS) counts (a.k.a. spacecraft clock
times). This is due first to the fact that Voyager 1 and 2 flew concurrently,
so there is inter-spacecraft duplication, and second because of spacecraft
clock resets and rollovers that occurred, causing duplication within data
sets. Users are cautioned therefore, that the FDS count is not a unique
identifier for an image. A unique query must include the spacecraft ID, the
FDS count, and the target.

There are two targets which may cause some confusion; ROCK and SYSTEM. Most
ROCKs have names but some were potential satellites that never came to
fruition or which may be named sometime in the future. The target SYSTEM
indicates a image of the Saturn System or a section of that which will be used
in conjunction with other sections to create a mosaic.

The target DARK is a dark current image when the camera mode is in bodark and
the exposure is zero.
