# Voyager Wave Subsystem (PWS)

Plasma Wave Receivers (PWS) built and operated by The University of Iowa are
among the science instruments flown on Voyagers 1 and 2. Each identical PWS
instrument consists of both a 16-channel spectrum analyzer covering the range
of 10 Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and a wideband waveform receiver which returns
the waveform of waves in the frequency range of 40 Hertz to 12 kiloHertz. The
spectrum analyzer provides data on a continual basis with a maximum temporal
resolution of one spectrum per 4 seconds. The waveform receiver returns 4-bit
samples of the electric field measured at a rate of 28,800 samples per second.
Because of the very high data rate, the waveform samples must be transmitted
in the same manner as the Voyager imaging information. At Jupiter, some 10,000
48-second waveform frames were obtained. At Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the
number of frames obtained was very small due to the lower telemetry rates
available at the greater distances of those planets.

## Science Objectives

The primary science objective of the Voyager plasma wave investigation is to
make the first surveys of the plasma wave and low frequency radio wave spectra
in the magnetospheres of the outer planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and
Neptune. Plasma waves participate in a fundamental manner in the dynamics of
planetary magnetospheres and in the interactions of that magnetosphere with
the external solar wind and internal perturbations such as those induced by
satellites interior to the magnetosphere. Plasma waves also provide diagnostic
information about the plasma environment near the planets including such
parameters as electron density and sometimes temperature. The instrument is
also sensitive to low frequency radio emissions and, therefore, acts as a low
frequency extension to the Planetary Radio Astronomy investigation. Radio
waves are often the only means of remotely observing regions of plasma not
accessible to the spacecraft and also lead to remote diagnostics of plasma
conditions. The plasma wave receivers are also sensitive to the results of
small dust particles impacting on various parts of the spacecraft at high
velocities and, hence, provide a direct measure of the rate of impact, the
density of the dust, and an estimate of the mass distribution of dust in the
vicinity of the large planets, especially those with rings and otherwise dusty
environments. Finally, the Plasma Wave Receiver will characterize the plasma
wave and radio wave spectrum of the outer heliosphere and perhaps beyond,
extending our understanding of solar wind plasma processes and wave-particle
interactions to several tens of Astronomical Units.

## Operational Considerations

The primary operational considerations of the PWS include maintaining the
proper operating mode and obtaining waveform samples as often as the
spacecraft tape recorder/downlink capabilities allow. The standard instrument
mode is with Waveform Power On and Input Gain State Hi. For encounter periods,
this corresponds to GS3GAINHI/WFMPWRON. Since there has never been a period
when the signal levels were so high as to require the Low input gain state,
and it is highly unlikely that such levels will ever be encountered, Low Input
Gain State should never be selected. As long as there is power margin
available, it is most straightforward to leave the Waveform Receiver Power on.
The power consumption is less than 0.5 Watt for this section, hence, the power
savings afforded by turning it off is not large. The most involved operational
consideration is providing for the transmission of waveform data to the
ground. At Jupiter, the majority of the waveform data could be sent directly
to the ground via the 115200 bps downlink. This capability disappeared after
Jupiter, however, because of the greater distance to the spacecraft, hence,
lower telecon rates. Since operating the A/D converter at a rate less than
28800 Hertz would result in aliasing, it is necessary to record the data at
the 115200 bps rate on the spacecraft tape recorder using the appropriate data
mode and playback the recorded data at a lower rate, commensurate with the
link capabilities. Again, a choice of the proper playback mode is required.
Since the data modes available on the spacecraft are highly dependent on
mission phase, these modes are not described here.

## Calibration Description

The Voyager plasma wave receiver spectrum analyzers were calibrated by first
establishing a relationship between input voltage (of a sine wave at the
filter center frequency) and output voltage and second by measuring the
effective bandwidth of the filter. The bandwidth is measured by applying a
random noise signal of known spectral density and by measuring the output
voltage which, by the first part of the calibration, is related to the rms
voltage of a sine wave. Dividing the equivalent sine wave voltage squared by
the input spectral density gives a bandwidth. This procedure is repeated for
each of the frequency channels.
