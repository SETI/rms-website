# Volume Bundles at the Ring-Moon Systems Node

### For user convenience, we provide archived volumes that can be downloaded as a single file.

  * These can be recognized by file names that end in "``.tar.gz``"
  * These are standard Unix tar files further compressed using gnuzip.

### A large number of decompression programs can handle this format.

  * In MacOS, you can simply double-click on the file and it will expand automatically.
  * At the Unix command line, type: ``tar xvfz <filename>.tar.gz`` to expand.
  * In Windows, you can use an application such as WinZip or 7-Zip to expand these files.
