## 1.Documentation

Please read the documentation carefully. The CIRS team has made a remarkable
effort to provide useful information, including providing calibrated spectra
for all of their data.

** Users are strongly encouraged to review a CIRS <a href="orig_AAREADME.TXT" target="_blank">AAREADME.TXT</a> file.** This file appears in the root directory of every volume and provides a good overview of the data set.

A number of additional documents are included in the
[DOCUMENT](/link/volumes/COCIRS_0xxx/COCIRS_0403/DOCUMENT/) subdirectory on each volume. Those
files are summarized in the <a href="orig_DOCINFO.TXT" target="_blank">DOCINFO.TXT</a> file. A copy of
this file is included in the DOCUMENT subdirectory of every original volume.

In particular, further details of the CIRS archive volumes can be found in the
"Software Interface Specification" (SIS) Documents, found in the DOCUMENTS
directory on each volume.

  * The Data Product and Label SIS is available as <a href="DATASIS.PDF" target="_blank">DOCUMENT/DATASIS.PDF</a> and <a href="DATASIS.txt" target="_blank">DOCUMENT/DATASIS.TEX</a>.
  * The Volume Organization SIS is available as <a href="VOLSIS.PDF" target="_blank">DOCUMENT/VOLSIS.PDF</a> and <a href="VOLSIS.txt" target="_blank">DOCUMENT/VOLSIS.TEX</a>.

The [CATALOG](/link/volumes/COCIRS_0xxx/COCIRS_0403/CATALOG/) subdirectory on each volume
contains a wealth of information about the CIRS instrument, team and data set.
See, in particular:

  * <a href="orig_DATASET.txt" target="_blank">COCIRS_xxxx/CATALOG/DATASET.CAT</a>: Description of the data sets.
  * <a href="INST.txt" target="_blank">COCIRS_xxxx/CATALOG/INST.CAT</a>: Description of the CIRS instrument.
  * <a href="INSTHOST.txt" target="_blank">COCIRS_xxxx/CATALOG/INSTHOST.CAT</a>: Description of the Cassini spacecraft.
  * <a href="MISSION.txt" target="_blank">COCIRS_xxxx/CATALOG/MISSION.CAT</a>: Description of the Cassini mission.

A file, <a href="orig_ERRATA.TXT" target="_blank">ERRATA.TXT</a>, in the root directory of each volume
documents any known anomalies or deviations from PDS standards contained in
that volume.

Additional descriptions of the instrument can be found at the <a href="https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/composite-infrared-spectrometer/" target="_blank">Cassini CIRS web page</a> maintained at JPL.
