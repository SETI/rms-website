## Getting the Data You Want

  * Use **[OPUS]({{ site.opus_url }}){:target="_blank"}**, our versatile search engine to find and retrieve specific Cassini CIRS data products using a wide range of criteria. However, OPUS currently only supports CIRS data submitted prior to July 2011.

      * Search results include data files, tables of associated meta data, and footprint diagrams for each observation. User selected data files can be bundled as [tar.gz](/help/targz.html) files for easy downloading.

    * The table below contains links to all of the available data volumes from the Saturn encounter re-formatted into fixed length data files. For information on the re-formatted data, see [About Re-formatted Data.](reform_about.html)

      * **Review** the Volume on-line by clicking the volume number.

      * **Download** an entire volume, by right clicking on that volume's "Bundled" link in the second column.

The bundled volumes are provided in [tar.gz](/help/targz.html) format.

Be aware that even with a 4:1 compression ratio, the Bundled versions can be
on the order of 4GB and may take a few hours to download. Users are encouraged
to download during the late night/early morning hours California time.

  * **Footprint** will take you to a directory containing footprint diagrams of each CIRS observation in the volume.

The footprint diagrams contain a wealth of information. The key for these diagrams is given in <a href="COCIRS_previews.txt" target="_blank">COCIRS_previews.txt</a>.

## Available Volumes

  * The dates at the beginning of each section in the table below correspond to **the scheduled delivery to PDS.**

  * To determine which volumes meet the publicly available criteria for a specific ROSES Announcement please see the appropriate DAP page under our [Proposal Support](/roses) pages.

  * **All reformtted volumes are based on version 2 of the original format data.**
