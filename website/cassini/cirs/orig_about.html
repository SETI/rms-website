###  1\. Introduction to CIRS Data

![\[SPACER\]](../css/spacer.gif)

For full details about the CIRS instrument, see
[COCIRS_xxxx/CATALOG/INST.CAT](INST.txt): an INST.CAT file.

The CIRS instrument has several unusual properties, which have made the CIRS
data particularly challenging to work with:

(a) The instrument has variable resolution, which means that the number of
samples in a spectrum varies from one observation to the next, and sometimes
within a single observation.

(b) The instrument has three focal planes, referred to as FP1, FP3 and FP4.
(FP2 was eliminated in a descope). Because the three focal planes typically
operate simultaneously, a single observation from the instrument can generate
spectra covering several different ranges of wavenumber.

(c) A great deal of processing is required to go from the raw interferograms
to the calibrated CIRS spectra that a typical user requires. For this reason,
the CIRS team has kindly archived calibrated data (called apodized spectra) in
addition to the raw data. (Note that the calibration procedure is continuing
to evolve; if you want the latest, most reliable calibration of a spectrum, it
would be best to contact a member of the CIRS team.)

(d) Although FP1 has a single circular field of view, FP3 and FP4 each consist
of ten square pixels, of which five can be read out at a given time. Each
pixel captures a different region of a target, and sometimes a different
target. For this reason, the CIRS team has archived extensive tables of
geometric metadata along with each spectrum, describing the instantaneous
field of view of each pixel.

To solve the problems of working with this complicated data set, the CIRS team
has developed a software package called Vanilla, and has archived the data in
a format that is closely tied to the software. For example, because the
spectra have different lengths, the CIRS team has adopted a binary, variable-
length record format, combined with an index that describes where to find a
particular spectrum within the larger data file. In addition, data from the
different focal planes are interspersed within the same file. Data files
themselves are organized simply by time, where a single file contains every
spectrum obtained within a single interval, typically lasting 8 hours.

The Vanilla software makes it relatively easy for users to retrieve a desired
selection of spectra from these files. However, those who do not use Vanilla
might find it difficult to access the CIRS data in the original format.
Consequently, the Rings Node is producing a re- formatted, parallel data set
for all of the Saturn encounter data

###  2\. Software

![\[SPACER\]](../css/spacer.gif)

The [SOFTWARE](SOFTWARE/) directory on each volume contains subdirectories
providing both binary (Solaris and Linux) and source code for the data
analysis tool, Vanilla, as well as a substantial amount of Vanilla related
documentation and examples.
