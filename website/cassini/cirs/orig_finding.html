## Finding the Data You Want

###  1\. Search Options

  * **Use our search engine, [OPUS]({{ site.opus_url }}){:target="_blank"} to search for specific Cassini CIRS data products using a wide range of criteria.**

    * Search results include data files, tables of associated metadata, and footprint diagrams for each observation. User selected data files can be bundled as [tar.gz](/help/targz.html) files for easy downloading.

  * The [Access Original Format Data](access_orig.html) tab, provides a link to each volume and gives the time interval covered by the volume.

  * For more detailed searching, you can use the VOLUME_ID, coupled with subdirectory and file names (browse the data directories), or the INDEX.TAB files to find specific data (see below).

###  2\. Interpreting the VOLUME_ID

The volume ID takes the form **COCIRS_XXXX**, where

  * **COCIRS** is the PDS abbreviation for Cassini Orbiter, Composite Infrared Spectrometer.
  * **XXXX** is the beginning month for the data volume, in the form YYMM starting with 0010. The data volume IDs are not sequential, particularly for the pre-SOI phase.

A brief overview of the various file types is given in a file
[DATAINFO.TXT](orig_DATAINFO.TXT){:target="_blank"} in the DATA directory of each volume.

A comprehensive description of the file structure and various data 'fragments'
is given in the Data Product and Label SIS, found in the DOCUMENTS directory
on every volume:

  * [DOCUMENT/DATASIS.PDF](DATASIS.PDF){:target="_blank"} and [DOCUMENT/DATASIS.TXT](DATASIS.txt){:target="_blank"}.

###  3\. Volume INDEX files

Each volume has an [INDEX](/link/volumes/COCIRS_0xxx/COCIRS_0010/INDEX/){:target="_blank"} subdirectory
containing several files including:

  * [INDXINFO.TXT](COCIRS_0010_INDXINFO_TXT.txt){:target="_blank"}: summarizes the structure and contents of the files in the INDEX subdirectory.

**Users are encouraged to read an INDXINFO.TXT before working with the files in the INDEX subdirectory.**
  * [INDEX.TAB](COCIRS_0010_INDEX_TAB.txt){:target="_blank"}: an ASCII table file with one row for each data file on the volume. For Cassini CIRS, each index table contains only 8 columns and has limited utility for narrowing a search unless you know the time associated with the data for which you are searching. This example is from volume COCIRS_0010.

  * [INDEX.LBL](COCIRS_0010_INDEX_LBL.txt){:target="_blank"}: the detached PDS label file for the INDEX.TAB file. This is a text file giving names and definitions of all the columns in the index.

  * C*_TOL.ASC and S*_TOL.ASC: Text tables listing all the spacecraft activities during the period (C23, S01 etc). C = (C)ruise sequence (prior to SOI); S = tour (S)equence. These may be used for determining the times of individual observations.
