### 1\. Documentation for the CIRS Re-formatted Data

There are three key documents specific to the re-formatted data set:

  * AAREADME.TXT file. A copy of this file is found in the root directory of every re-formatted volume.

  * TUTORIAL.TXT file. A copy of this file is found in the DOCUMENT directory of every re-formatted volume.

  * DATASET.CAT file. A copy of this file is found in the CATALOG directory of every re-formatted volume.

### 2\. Additional Documentation

  * A number of additional documents are included in the **DOCUMENT** subdirectory on each volume.
Those files are summarized in the DOCINFO.TXT file. A copy of this file is included in the DOCUMENT 
subdirectory of every re-formatted volume.

  * The **CATALOG** subdirectory on each volume contains a wealth of information about the CIRS instrument, team and data set. See, in particular:

    * COCIRS_xxxx/CATALOG/INST.CAT: Description of the CIRS instrument.
    * COCIRS_xxxx/CATALOG/INSTHOST.CAT: Description of the Cassini spacecraft.
    * COCIRS_xxxx/CATALOG/MISSION.CAT: Description of the Cassini mission.

  * A file, ERRATA.TXT, in the root directory of each volume documents any known anomalies or deviations from PDS standards contained in that volume.

  * Additional descriptions of the instrument can be found at the [Cassini CIRS web page maintained at JPL](//saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/composite-infrared-spectrometer/){:target="_blank"}.
