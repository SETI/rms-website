## About Re-formatted CIRS Data

These pages contain excerpts from the [TUTORIAL.TXT](TUTORIAL.TXT) file, found
in the DOCUMENT directory on each re-formatted volume. See TUTORIAL.TXT for
extensive guidance on how to use the data.

###  1\. Overview of the Re-Formatted Data Set

This data set has been designed to ease the access to the CIRS data set for
scientists who do not use Vanilla. It simplifies the selection of data subsets
based on target, CIMS request or CIRS focal plane. The reorganization also
eliminates the need for variable-length files, on the assumption that users
will have a much easier time writing programs to read fixed-length records.

The re-formatted data set has the following properties.

(a) File boundaries correspond to CIMS requests, so the data associated with
individual Cassini activities are found within a single set of files; no file
contains information from more than one CIMS activity.

(b) Data files have been divided up by focal plane.

(c) Metadata files (mainly timing and geometry) have been restructured to
contain the identical record sequence as that in the corresponding data files.
Users will find an exact 1:1 correspondence between the records in each data
file and the records in the metadata files.

(d) All information except the actual thermal spectra are available in ASCII
format. Most users find ASCII files easier to read than binary files. However,
because the spectra are quite large, they are only archived in binary.

###  2\. Volume Names

The original CIRS data volumes are named COCIRS_yymm, where yy is the last two
digits of the year and mm is the month number (01 through 12).

These re-formatted volumes are also organized by month. To distinguish the two
data sets, re-formatted volumes have 50 added to the year. For example, the
data in original volume COCIRS_0407 can be found, in the alternative form, in
volume COCIRS_5407.

###  3\. Introduction to the Cassini Timeline

The Cassini timeline has been allocated in terms of specific activities,
sometimes referred to as "CIMS requests." Here "CIMS" stands for the "Cassini
Information Management System." A CIMS request corresponds to a particular
block of time in which one or more instruments observe (usually) a single
target. In the Cassini timeline, one instrument is always "prime" and defines
the details of the observation, such as where the instrument points and how
long it dwells at each location. Often, additional instruments are "riders"
and will obtain simultaneous data from the same target.

CIMS requests have identifiers such as this:

CIRS_016RE_E60PHASE001_VIMS

It is constructed as follows:

CIRS: Indicates the instrument doing the observation, regardless of whether it
is prime or a rider.

016: Indicates Cassini's orbit number

RE: Abbreviation for the nominal target, in this case Ring E.

E60PHASE: A brief mnemonic indicating the purpose of the observation, in this
case to gather the phase curve information around 60 degrees.

001: For the first activity of this type in the given orbit of Cassini.

VIMS: Finally, this indicates that the VIMS (Visual and Infrared Mapping
Spectrometer) instrument is prime for the observation. If CIRS had been prime,
the identifier would have ended with PRIME instead.

**The CIMS request ID associated with a given file can be found in the PDS label as the value for the keyword OBSERVATION_ID.**
