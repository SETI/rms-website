###  1\. Search Options

  * **Use our search engine, [OPUS]({{ site.opus_url }}){:target="_blank"} to search for specific Cassini CIRS data 
   using a wide range of criteria.**

    * Search results include data files, tables of associated metadata, and footprint diagrams for each observation. 
    User selected data files can be bundled as [tar.gz]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/targz.html) files for easy downloading.

  * The [Access Re-formatted Data](access_reform.html) page provides a link to each volume and gives the time interval 
  covered by the volume.

  * As you develop your personal search strategies, you may wish to refer to the  [TUTORIAL.TXT]({{site.holdings_url}}documents/COCIRS_5xxx/Tutorial.txt){:target="_blank"} file which contains the definitive documentation on the contents and structure of the re-formatted CIRS data.

###  2\. Using Indices

Volume specific index files are located in the INDEX subdirectory on each
volume. You can use the index files to refine a search within the volume.
Index files have PDS labels, and those labels refer to .FMT files in the same
directory that describe the column structure in each index.

  * The master index file INDEX/INDEX.TAB contains the general information about every data file on the volume 
  (one data file per line). One keyword reported in the INDEX.TAB files is OBSERVATION_ID which contains the unique 
  CIMS request ID associated with a given file. For information about how to interpret the CIMS ID, see section
  [3\. Introduction to the Cassini Timeline](reform_about.html#cims) under the About CIRS Re-formtted Data tab.

  * Supplemental index files INDEX/RININDEX.TAB, INDEX/POIINDEX.TAB and INDEX/ISPMINDEX.TAB contain tables of 
  these additional parameters. They can be used for identifying, for example, which observation captured a particular 
  latitude, longitude and incidence angle on the surface of Enceladus.

  * More detailed searches can be conducted by reading the metadata files row by row, which will enable you to identify 
  the specific detectors that captured a target under the desired circumstances.

###  3\. Directory and File Names

  * Another option is to use the VOLUME_ID, coupled with subdirectory and file names and browse the data directories. 
  See the [Naming Conventions: Re-formtted Data](reform_dir_names.html) tab for insights into the naming structures for the re-formatted data set.

### 4\. Where to go next

  * Use the tabs at the top of this page to obtain more information about the re-formatted data.
