## Cassini CIRS

The Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) consists of two
spectrometers (far-Infrared and mid-Infrared). It measures the infrared energy
from Saturn, its rings and its moons. CIRS observations of Saturn's rings
should determine the thermal structure of the the rings and provide insights
into ring material composition and ring particle size.

Calibrated CIRS data from the Saturn encounter is now available in two
formats. See the [About CIRS Data](about.html) Tab for information about the
formats.

**Cassini CIRS Data User Guide**.

  * The **[CIRS User Guide]({{ site.holdings_url }}documents/COCIRS_0xxx/CIRS-Users-Guide.pdf){:target="_blank"}** is available from the PDS Ring-Moon Systems Node holdings. 

##  The CIRS Tabs
