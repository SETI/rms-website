## {{ page.title }}

The Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) consists of two
spectrometers (far-Infrared and mid-Infrared). It measures the infrared energy
from Saturn, its rings and its moons. CIRS observations of Saturn's rings
should determine the thermal structure of the the rings and provide insights
into ring material composition and ring particle size.

### CIRS data from the Saturn encounter is available in two formats

  * [Original format](orig_about.html) - Data for the entire mission in its original format
  * [Reformatted data](reform_about.html) - Data that has been reformated by the RMS node to improve useability; Saturn Encounter from January 2004 thru June 2010
