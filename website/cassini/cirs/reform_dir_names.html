## {{ page.title }}

This page contains a brief overview of the directory and file structure of the
re-formatted volumes. For a more complete discussion, see the
[TUTORIAL.TXT]({{site.holdings_url}}documents/COCIRS_5xxx/Tutorial.txt){:target="_blank"} file. There is a copy of this file in the
DOCUMENT directory on each re-formatted volume. The following discussion is
extracted from the TUTORIAL.TXT.

###  1\. Directory Names

The DATA directory on each volume contains five subdirectories, each of which
contains a particular type of file:

APODSPEC - apodized, i.e. calibrated and resampled, spectra.

GEODATA - position and viewing geometry of the planet and moons.

POIDATA - pointing geometry on the planet or moon.

RINDATA - pointing geometry on the ring system.

TARDATA - listing of target bodies captured.

###  2\. File Names

Data files are generally named as follows:

aaayymmddhhmm_FPn.*

aaa - a prefix indicating the file type:

ISPM = interpolated spectrum (APODSPEC subdirectory);

GEO = system geometry (GEODATA subdirectory);

POI = planet and satellite pointing (POIDATA subdirectory);

RIN = ring pointing (RINDATA subdirectory);

TAR = target body listing (TARDATA subdirectory).

yymmdd - two-digit year, month and day when the observation began.

hhmm - two-digit hour and approximate minute (UTC) when the observation began.

n - CIRS focal plane number: 1, 3 or 4.

Note that the prefixes ISPM, GEO, POI, RIN and TAR have direct analogs to the
files in the original CIRS volumes. The ISPM files are found in the
DATA/APODSPEC subdirectories and the others are found in the DATA/NAV_DATA
subdirectories.

GEO files contain an additional suffix.:

GEOyymmddhhmm_FPn_bbb.*

bbb - the NAIF body ID indicating which moon's position and viewing geometry
is described by the file. The NAIF ID for Saturn is 699. The NAIF IDs for the
Saturnian satellites are assigned as follows:

NAIF ID | Body | NAIF ID | Body | NAIF ID | Body
---|---|---|---|---|---
601 | Mimas | 607 | Hyperion | 613 | Telesto
602 | Enceladus | 608 | Iapetus | 614 | Calypso
603 | Tethys | 609 | Phoebe | 615 | Atlas
604 | Dione | 610 | Janus | 616 | Prometheus
605 | Rhea | 611 | Epimetheus | 617 | Pandora
606 | Titan | 612 | Helene | 618 | Pan

Some binary ISPM files (in the APODSPEC subdirectory) contain an additional
suffix:

ISPMyymmddhhmm_FPnx.*

x A, B, C, ....

The suffix changes each time the spectral resolution changes in the middle of
a single CIMS request. In most cases, the resolution stays fixed for an entire
request, in which case no suffix appears. This suffix is necessary to avoid
using variable-length data files.

###  3\. File Types

We refer to the ISPM files as data files and the GEO, POI, RIN and TAR files
as metadata files.

Most files come in matched pairs, consisting of one ASCII table (*.TAB) and
one binary table (*.DAT). These are described by the same combined-detached
PDS label *.LBL. In general, the ASCII and binary files contain exactly the
same information. The ASCII file may be simpler for the user to read but the
binary file contains potentially more precise numeric information.

Here is an example:

RIN0407020156_FP3.DAT: binary table;

RIN0407020156_FP3.TAB: ASCII table;

RIN0407020156_FP3.LBL: combined-detached PDS label.

In addition, you will need the following format information to interpret the
files:

RIN_ASCII.FMT: PDS 'include' file describing the columns and format of the
ASCII file.

RIN_BINARY.FMT: PDS 'include' file describing the columns and format of the
binary file.

They are found in the same subdirectory as the data files. As discussed below,
the PDS labels contain a complete, detailed description of the format of each
file.

The ISPM files are somewhat exceptional. The spectra are only found in the
binary files; the ASCII files APODSPEC/ISPM*.TAB contain the header
information about each CIRS spectrum but do not contain the spectra
themselves. Also, although the binary ISPM files are occasionally broken up
into pieces with suffixes A, B, C, etc., the ASCII file concatenates the
information for the entire activity. (A column in the ASCII file indicates
which binary file contains the corresponding spectrum).

Here is an example:

ISPM0407020930_FP1.TAB: ASCII table describing the whole observation.

ISPM0407020930_FP1.LBL: PDS label for the above.

ISPM0407020930_FP1A.DAT: binary table containing the first part of the data.

ISPM0407020930_FP1A.LBL: PDS label for the above.

ISPM0407020930_FP1B.DAT: binary table containing the second part of the data.

ISPM0407020930_FP1B.LBL: PDS label for the above.
