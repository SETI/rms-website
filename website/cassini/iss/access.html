## Getting the Data You Want

  * Use **[OPUS]({{ site.opus_url }}){:target="_blank"}**,
our versatile search engine to find and retrieve specific Cassini ISS data products using a wide range of criteria.

    * **Calibrated versions of each Cassini ISS image can be downloaded from OPUS search results.**

    * Search results also include raw images, tables of associated metadata, and thumbnail images for each observation. User selected data files can be bundled as [tar.gz]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/targz.html) files for easy downloading.

  * **[Viewmaster]({{ site.viewmaster_url }}){:target="_blank"}** is our new (2018) tool for browsing our on-line data volumes. This link takes you directly to the volumes directory. COISS_0xxx contains calibration files and software. COISS_1xxx contains the Jupiter encounter observations. COISS_2xxx contains the Saturn encounter observations. COISS_3xxx contains Cassini Cartographic Maps.

  * Links to **calibrated images** from the Saturn encounter phase, organized by volume number, are included in the table below.

  * For links to the complete set of **calibration data**, see [ISS Calibration](calibration.html).

  * For discussions of available ISS calibration and image analysis **software**, see [ISS Software](software.html).

  * For links to volumes containing **cartographic maps**, see [ISS Cartographic Maps](cartographic.html).

  * For links to the **cruise and Jupiter data**, see [Cruise Data](access_cruise.html).

  * For links to the **Saturn encounter data**, see the table below.

    * Clicking on the VOLUME_ID will allow you to browse the volume.

    * To download an entire volume, right click on that volume's "Bundled" link in the second column.

The bundled volumes are provided in [tar.gz]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/targz.html) format.

  * Browse images for each volume can be viewed by following the "Browse Images" link for that volume.

  * Calibrated images for each volume can be found by following the "Calibrated Images" link for that volume.

## Available Volumes

  * The dates at the beginning of each section in the table below correspond to **the scheduled delivery to PDS.**

  * To determine which volumes meet the publicly available criteria for a specific ROSES Announcement please see the appropriate DAP page under our [Proposal Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/roses) pages.

  * The content of the /document/report/ subdirectory on each data volume provides summaries of the data quality and image anomalies present on that volume.
