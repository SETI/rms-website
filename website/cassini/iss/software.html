## Software

**Software available or in development for general release:**

### 1\. VICAR Image Processing System


  * [VICAR](//www-mipl.jpl.nasa.gov/vicar_open.html){:target="_blank"}
    is an open source image processing system developed and used by the Multimission Image Processing
    Lab (MIPL) at JPL.
  * VICAR was developed for use with JPL's planetary missions, and the VICAR format is compatible with both PDS3 and PDS4.
  * Questions regarding the installation and use of VICAR should be sent to: vicar_help@jpl.nasa.gov

### 2\. Calibration Software

  * **CISSCAL** is the ISS team developed, IDL based, calibration software. CISSCAL is available
    in the extras directory of [COISS_0011 volume]({{ site.viewmaster_url }}volumes/COISS_0xxx/COISS_0011/extras/){:target="_blank"}.
    The entire volume can be [downloaded here]({{ site.viewmaster_url }}archives-volumes/COISS_0xxx/COISS_0011.tar.gz){:target="_blank"}.

    * The volume, COISS_0011, also contains a collection of calibration data files, calibration software processing files, sample calibrated images
      and related documentation.

    * The ISS User's Guide, [iss_data_user_guide_180916.pdf]({{ site.holdings_url }}volumes/COISS_0xxx/COISS_0011/document/iss_data_user_guide_180916.pdf){:target="_blank"} is the definitive source for instructions on the use of CISSCAL.

    * View a table of all [CISSCAL release dates](cisscal_release_dates.txt){:target="_blank"}

    **Note: Establishing a local ISS calibration pipeline has proven challenging, users are encouraged to first consider using the calibrated
    images available from the Ring-Moon Systems Node. See [Accessing Data](access.html), or the options available from the USGS web site (below).**

  * For links to the complete calibration data set, see [ISS Calibration](calibration.html).

  * [ISS calibration pipeline](//github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/wiki/Working_with_Cassini_ISS_Data){:target="_blank"}
    using ISIS3 (Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers).

  * The USGS also offers a web service, [Map Projection on the Web](//astrocloud.wr.usgs.gov){:target="_blank"}
    (POW). POW provides users with calibrated cartographic images that can be used for geologic mapping, analysis in a Geographic Image System
    (GIS), change detection, merging of dissimilar instrument images, and use in a host of other scientific applications (e.g., ArcMAP, ENVI,
    Matlab, JMARS, etc.). Output formats currently supported include ISIS, PDS, GeoTiff, GeoJpeg2000, Jpeg, and PNG. POW supports Cassini ISS data.


### 3\. Data Analysis Software

  * ISS images are compatible with the Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) software package which is available
    through the [USGS Flagstaff web site](//isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/){:target="_blank"}.

  * [CAVIAR](ftp://ftp.imcce.fr/pub/softwares/caviar/){:target="_blank"}
    is an IDL based software package designed for the astrometric measurement of natural satellite positions in images taken using
    the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) of the Cassini spacecraft. For more information, see Cooper, et al., A&A 610, A2 (2018),
    [DOI: 10.1051/0004-6361/201731713](//doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201731713){:target="_blank"}.

  * [OMINAS](//github.com/nasa/ominas){:target="_blank"} (pronounced like 'ominous') is an
    IDL-based software environment for the reduction and analysis of data taken by any space-based or planet-based system. The
    linked github repository includes extensive documentation.

  * CASVU is designed specifically for ISS image data analysis. It operates under IDL and can be run under IDL VM software
    which is available at no cost. CASVU and its users' manual will be available soon. We will supply links to the appropriate
    pages when they become available.

### 4\. Image Viewing Software

  * Images archived by the PDS, when accompanied by their respective label files, can be viewed using the PDS tool
    [NASAView](//pds.nasa.gov/tools/about/pds3-tools/nasa-view.shtml){:target="_blank"}.

  * Piotr Masek has developed the [Cassini Orbiter Image Viewer](//petermasek.tripod.com/cassini.html){:target="_blank"},
    an easy to use viewer for Cassini ISS images. Although it is not designed for doing science, it does let you look at the images
    quickly and offers some toggles (no detailed control) to stretch & rotate images.
