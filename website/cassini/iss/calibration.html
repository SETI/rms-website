##  Calibrated Images

  * Calibrated versions of each Cassini ISS image from the Saturn encounter phase can be downloaded from **[OPUS](/search)** search results.

  * You also can access calibrated versions of each Cassini ISS image from the Saturn encounter phase, organized by volume number, from the the table on the [Accessing Data](access.html) tab.

##  Calibration Software

Calibration software is available on the
[COISS_0011](/link/volumes/COISS_0xxx/COISS_0011/) volume. The entire volume can be
downloaded by right clicking [here](/link/archives-volumes/COISS_0xxx/COISS_0011.tar.gz)
([tar.gz](/help/targz.html) format).

<a href="owen_2003_iss_distortion_model-1.pdf" target="_blank">ISS Distortion</a>. Provides an alternate Distortion Model for Cassini ISS.


For discussions of available ISS calibration and image analysis software, see
[ISS Software)](software.html).

##  Calibration Files

The calibration documents and pre-flight ground calibration images are
contained on volumes COISS_0001-0010.

### Documentation

Detailed information on the various calibration tests is contained in the
complete set of documents found in the [document](COISS_0011_DOCUMENT/)
directory on each volume. These include:

  * The ISS Users' Guide: <a href="iss_data_user_guide_180916.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a> is the primary reference for ISS calibration. 

  * The ISS Calibration Report: [report](COISS_0011_DOCUMENT/report/). 
  
  * The in-flight calibration plan: <a href="COISS_0011_DOCUMENT/in_flight_cal.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a> or [TeX](COISS_0011_DOCUMENT/in_flight_cal.tex). 
  
  * Calibration theoretical basis report: <a href="COISS_0011_DOCUMENT/theoretical_basis.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a> or [TeX](COISS_0011_DOCUMENT/theoretical_basis.tex). 
  
### Calibration Data

The calibration test data are found within the
[data](/link/volumes/COISS_0xxx/COISS_0001/data/) directory tree on volumes
COISS_0001-0010.

On each Volume, separate subdirectories contain data for the narrow-angle and
wide-angle cameras (NACFM and WACFM respectively). Within each of these
directories, subdirectories are named to indicate which test the enclosed data
supports.

### The table below indicates where to find calibration data for a particular
camera and test.

  * Clicking on the VOLUME_ID will allow you to browse the volume. 
  
  * To download an entire volume, right click on that volume's "Bundle" link in the second row of each section. 

The bundled volumes are provided in [tar.gz](/help/targz.html) format.
