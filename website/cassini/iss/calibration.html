##  Calibrated Images

  * Calibrated versions of each Cassini ISS image from the Saturn encounter phase can be downloaded from **[OPUS](/search)** search results.

  * You also can access calibrated versions of each Cassini ISS image from the Saturn encounter phase, organized by volume number, from the the table on the [Accessing Data](access.html) tab.

##  Calibration Software

Calibration software is available on the
[COISS_0011](/vol/COISS_0xxx/COISS_0011/) volume. The entire volume can be
downloaded by right clicking [ here](/archives/COISS_0xxx/COISS_0011.tar.gz)
(.tar.gz format).

For discussions of available ISS calibration and image analysis software, see
[ISS Software)](software.html).

##  Calibration Files

The calibration documents and pre-flight ground calibration images are
contained on volumes COISS_0001-0010.

### Documentation

Detailed information on the various calibration tests is contained in the
complete set of documents found in the [document](COISS_0011_DOCUMENT/)
directory on each volume. These include:

  * The ISS Calibration Report: [report](COISS_0011_DOCUMENT/report/). 
  
  * The in-flight calibration plan: [pdf](COISS_0011_DOCUMENT/in_flight_cal.pdf) or [text](COISS_0011_DOCUMENT/in_flight_cal.txt). 
  
  * Calibration theoretical basis report: [pdf](COISS_0011_DOCUMENT/theoretical_basis.pdf) or [text](COISS_0011_DOCUMENT/theoretical_basis.txt). 
  
  * CISSCAL calibration software manual: [pdf](COISS_0011_DOCUMENT/cisscal_manual.pdf) or [text](COISS_0011_DOCUMENT/cisscal_manual.txt). 

### Calibration Data

The calibration test data are found within the
[data](/vol/COISS_0xxx/COISS_0001/data/) directory tree on volumes
COISS_0001-0010.

On each Volume, separate subdirectories contain data for the narrow-angle and
wide-angle cameras (NACFM and WACFM respectively). Within each of these
directories, subdirectories are named to indicate which test the enclosed data
supports.

### The table below indicates where to find calibration data for a particular
camera and test.

  * Clicking on the VOLUME_ID will allow you to browse the volume. 
  
  * To download an entire volume, right click on that volume's "Bundle" link in the second row of each section. 

The bundled volumes are provided in .tar.gz format. For information on opening
files of this type, click [here](/targzip.htm).
