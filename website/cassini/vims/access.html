## VIMS Occultations

  * In addition to the raw data referenced below, the PDS RMS node has a data set of Saturn ring radial
    profiles derived from VIMS stellar occultation data obtained during the prime mission (2004-2008).
    The data include ring radial profiles at 1 and 10 km resolution from more than 60 VIMS stellar occultations.

  * You may browse the occultation dataset [COVIMS_8001]({{ site.viewmaster_url }}volumes/COVIMS_8xxx){:target="_blank"}, or download the entire dataset
    [COVIMS_8001 tar.gz]({{ site.holdings_url }}archives-volumes/COVIMS_8xxx/COVIMS_8001.tar.gz) (320 MB).

  * Version 2 of this dataset, which expands the dataset coverage to the entire mission, is expected to be available in
    early 2019.

  * **[VIMS occultation geometry tables (updated 4/3/17)]({{ site.assets_url }}cassini/vims/VIMS Cornell CIMS 180403.xlsx)**.
    This is a multi-tabbed Excel spreadsheet with information from the team's database for all VIMS occultations.
    There are a total of 15 tabs which organize the information in several different ways. The spreadsheet may be
    downloaded and sliced and diced to make your own listing. The current plan is to convert the spreadsheet into
    CSV tables and to include them in version 2 of the VIMS occultation dataset.

## Calibrated VIMS data cubes for the Saturnian Satellites.

  * The data submitted to PDS by the VIMS team is raw data.

  * The LPG-NANTES maintains a **[Cassini VIMS Data Portal](//vims.univ-nantes.fr/){:target="_blank"}**
    with **calibrated VIMS cubes for VIMS observations of Saturn's satellites**.

## Getting the VIMS Data You Want at the Ring-Moon Systems Node

You can **Search** for VIMS data using **[OPUS]({{ site.opus_url }}){:target="_blank"}** (Outer Planets Unified Search)

The table below contains temporal coverage information for, and links to, all
of the available VIMS data volumes from cruise, Jupiter, and Saturn.

  * Browse a volume on-line by clicking the volume ID.

  * Download an entire volume, by right clicking on that volume's "Bundled" link in the second table.

The bundled volumes are provided in [tar.gz](/help/targz.html) format.

  * Browse Images will take you to a directory containing sub-directories of preview images for each VIMS cube in the volume.

The preview images contain a wealth of information. The key for the preview
images is in the [VIMS-Preview-Interpretation-Guide]({{ site.holdings_url }}documents/COVIMS_0xxx/VIMS-Preview-Interpretation-Guide.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

## Available Volumes

  * The dates at the beginning of each section in the table below correspond to **the scheduled delivery to PDS.**

  * To determine which volumes meet the publicly available criteria for a specific ROSES Announcement please see the appropriate DAP page under our [Proposal Support](/roses) pages.
