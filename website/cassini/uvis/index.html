### Overview

The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) has two spectrographic
channels that provide images and spectra covering the ranges from 56 to 118 nm
and 110 to 190 nm. A third optical path with a solar blind CsI photo cathode is
used for a high signal-to- noise ratio, stellar occultation by rings and
atmospheres. A separate hydrogen deuterium absorption cell measures the
relative abundance of deuterium and hydrogen from their lyman-alpha emission.

###  The UVIS Occultations of Saturn's Rings

  * **May 3, 2019.** 
  
  * Version 2 of the dataset of Saturn ring radial profiles derived from UVIS stellar 
    occultation data is now available. The data include ring radial profiles at 1 and 10 km 
    resolution from more than 200 UVIS stellar occultations. 

  * You may browse the dataset [COUVIS_8001]({{ site.viewmaster_url }}volumes/COUVIS_8xxx/COVIMS_8001/){:target="_blank"}, or 
    download the entire dataset 
    [COUVIS_8001 tar.gz]({{ site.viewmaster_url }}archives-volumes/COUVIS_8xxx/). 

  * Version 2 of this dataset, corrects the known errors and expands the dataset coverage 
    to the entire mission. It includes:
    
    * reprocessed versions of the material contained in the original version;
    
    * in the document directory: the Cassini_UVIS_Ring_Occultation_Atlas, an eight volume document that contains tabular 
      lists of all UVIS stellar occultations including the star name, rev number, indication of 
      ingress (I) or egress (E), date of the occultation, duration of the occultation, radial range 
      coverage and elevation angle of the star. In addition, for each occultation the Atlas contains plots 
      showing the occultation geometry and raw signal vs. radius.
      
    * Details of the data processing involved in the production of this data set are provided in COLWELLETAL2010.
    
###  Cassini UVIS Data Users Guide

  * **July 2018.** An updated version of the **[UVIS User Guide]({{ site.holdings_url }}documents/COUVIS_0xxx/UVIS-Users-Guide.pdf){:target="_blank"}** is available.
