### Overview

The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) has two spectrographic
channels that provide images and spectra covering the ranges from 56 to 118 nm
and 110 to 190 nm. A third optical path with a solar blind CsI photo cathode is
used for a high signal-to- noise ratio, stellar occultation by rings and
atmospheres. A separate hydrogen deuterium absorption cell measures the
relative abundance of deuterium and hydrogen from their lyman-alpha emission.

###  The UVIS Occultations of Saturn's Rings

  * The PDS Rings node has a dataset of Saturn ring radial profiles derived from UVIS stellar occultation data obtained 
    during the prime mission. The data include ring radial profiles at 1 and 10 km resolution from more than 50 UVIS 
    stellar occultations. A few errors in the data have been identified and are listed in the ERRATA.TXT file in the 
    root directory of the volume.

  * You may browse the dataset [COUVIS_8001](/viewmaster/volumes/COUVIS_8xxx), or download the entire dataset 
    [COUVIS_8001 tar.gz](/viewmaster/archives-volumes/COUVIS_8xxx/). 
    
  * Version 2 of this dataset, which corrects the known errors and expands the dataset coverage to the entire mission, 
    is expected to be available in early 2019.
