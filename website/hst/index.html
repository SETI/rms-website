# HST Data at the PDS Ring-Moon Systems Node

The Ring-Moon Systems Node currently archives numerous volumes of data obtained by the
HST.

  * Observations of the Outer Planets from ACS, WFPC2, WFC3, STIS, NICMOS.

  * Small Satellite Astrometry data,

  * Saturn 1995 Ring Plane Crossing data.

### HST Observations of the Outer Planets

HST provides some of our finest Earth-based data on the outer planets.
Literally hundreds of planetary programs have been carried out using HST. All
HST products can be found in the Multimission Archive at STScI,
[MAST](//archive.stsci.edu/index.html){:target="_blank"}, and can be calibrated on-the-fly
prior to retrieval using the most current calibration files and algorithims.

Although the files are reliably archived, the STScI search interface is not
well adapted to planetary queries. In order to incorporate this rich data
collection into the search data base for our planetary science specific search
tool, **[OPUS]({{ site.opus_url }}){:target="_blank"}**, the Ring-Moon Systems Node has
developed a series of PDS compliant "data sets" of all HST observations of the
Outer Planets using ACS, WFPC2, WFC3, STIS, and NICMOS obtained since the initial Hubble
repair mission. We make periodic updates at roughly six month intervals for the
active supported instruments.

Although these "data sets" are PDS compliant, since their primary function is
to support OPUS and since STScI periodically improves their calibration
pipeline, our "data sets" **have not undergone a PDS peer review, and do not
contain the final calibrated versions of the data files.**

We have placed all of these "data sets" on-line for browsing and direct
download, but please note the caveats above.

The "data sets", have been sorted into volume set collections \- one for
each instrument. Within an instrument's volume set collection, each "data set"
corresponds to a single HST proposal.

Each "data set" contains detailed indices, TIFF and JPEG 'browse' versions of
each image accompanied by a simple text file containing all FITS header
information from the original image, and a PDS label file which includes
specific instructions for obtaining the calibrated version of the image from
STScI.

As of June 5, 2018 the ACS, WFPC2, and WFC3 "data sets", and their most recent
updates, have been incorportated into **[OPUS]({{ site.opus_url }}){:target="_blank"}**. We anticipate completing
the inclusion of the STIS and NICMOS "data sets" by the end of FY18.

The on-line directories are organized by instrument and proposal number.
Directory names are in the form HST#x_xxxx, where # is replaced by a single
letter that indicates which instrument obtained the data. We use the same
letter identifiers for the instruments as STScI, "I" = WFC3; "J" = ACS; "U" =
"WFPC2", "O" = STIS, "N" = NICMOS. These are available for directory tree browsing, or for downloading
as separate [tar.gz](/help/targz.html) files for each "data set".

  * ACS -   [Browsable Volumes](/link/volumes/HSTJx_xxxx/),    [downloadable tar.gz files](/link/archives-volumes/HSTJx_xxxx/)

  * NICMOS -  [Browsable Volumes](/link/volumes/HSTNx_xxxx/),    [downloadable tar.gz files](/link/archives-volumes/HSTNx_xxxx/)

  * STIS - [Browsable Volumes](/link/volumes/HSTOx_xxxx/),    [downloadable tar.gz files](/link/archives-volumes/HSTOx_xxxx/)

  * WFPC2 - [Browsable Volumes](/link/volumes/HSTUx_xxxx/),    [downloadable tar.gz files](/link/archives-volumes/HSTUx_xxxx/)

  * WFC3 -  [Browsable Volumes](/link/volumes/HSTIx_xxxx/),    [downloadable tar.gz files](/link/archives-volumes/HSTIx_xxxx/)

### Small Satellite Astrometry

The Ring-Moon Systems Node currently maintains two volumes of astrometric HST data for the small
satellites of Saturn. For more information about and links to the data, see
[Satellite Astrometry.](/astrometry/)

### Saturn Ring Plane Crossing (SRPX)

The Ring-Moon Systems Node currently has nine volumes of SRPX data of which the first five
volumes were obtained by the HST. For more information on the SRPX seasons,
the information about and links to the associated data and links to relevant
web sites, see [Saturn RPX.](/rpx/)

### Uranus Ring Plane Crossing (URPX)

The Ring-Moon Systems Node currently has no data from the URPX observing campaign. We do
anticipate receiving and archiving such data as it becomes available. For more
information on the URPX seasons and links to relevant web sites, see [Uranian
RPX.](/urpx/)
