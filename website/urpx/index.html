# The 2007-2008 Uranus Ring Plane Crossings

The Sun and Earth passed through Uranus' ring plane in 2007 and 2008, providing
a unique opportunity to observe Uranus' rings and smallest satellites. The
edge-on viewing geometry also permitted the timing of satellite eclipses and
mutual events that can be used to improve ephemerides.

## Data Sets

  * HST data of the URPX event can be found [here]({{ site.viewmaster_url }}){:target="_blank"}.

  * The PDS Ring-Moon Systems Node would be glad to archive additional data of the URPX event.  
    Observers interested in archiving data should contact [Matthew Tiscareno](//www.seti.org/our-scientists/matthew-tiscareno){:target="_blank"}


## Tools

  * The [Ring-Moon Systems Node On-Line Tools](/tools/) are available for visualizing the changing geometry 
    and assisting with observation planning.

## Links to external Uranus RPX and Equinox web sites.

  * The [International Outer Planet Watch Uranus and Neptune Discipline](//www.ajax.ehu.es/iopw/){:target="_blank"} includes 
    information on the planning for an international campaign of Uranian observations, the report from the 2006 'Uranus at Equinox' Pasadena Workshop, and several additional links.


  * The Institut de Mécanique Céléste et de Calcul des
    Ephémérides [IMCCE](//www.imcce.fr/){:target="_blank"} web
    site includes detailed information, software tools, and
    predictions of Uranian satellite mutual events as well as
    several additional links.

   * Additional mutual event predictions are available from
	[Armagh Observatory](//armagh.space/){:target="_blank"}
