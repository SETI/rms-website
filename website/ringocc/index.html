# Spacecraft-Based Ring Occultations

## Cassini

All three Cassini Ring Occultation datasets have been updated to version 2. Here are the links:

  * **RSS version 2** \- Browse the data set on-line [CORSS_8001](/link/volumes/CORSS_8xxx/CORSS_8001/), or download the entire data set [CORSS_8001 tar.gz](/link/archives-volumes/CORSS_8xxx/CORSS_8001.tar.gz). 
  * **UVIS version 2** \- Browse the data set on-line [COUVIS_8001](/link/volumes/COUVIS_8xxx/COUVIS_8001/), or download the entire data set [COUVIS_8001 tar.gz](/link/archives-volumes/COUVIS_8xxx/COUVIS_8001.tar.gz). 
  * **VIMS version 2** \- Browse the data set on-line [COVIMS_8001](/link/volumes/COVIMS_8xxx/COVIMS_8001/), or download the entire data set [COVIMS_8001 tar.gz](/link/archives-volumes/COVIMS_8xxx/COVIMS_8001.tar.gz). 

Details about each of the instruments are available from our [Cassini information pages](/cassini/).

<strong>5/3/19 Versions 2 of the UVIS dataset [COUVIS_8001](/link/volumes/COUVIS_8xxx/COUVIS_8001/) 
	and the VIMS dataset [COVIMS_8001](/link/volumes/COVIMS_8xxx/COVIMS_8001/) are available online.</strong> 

  * **UVIS Version 2 includes:** 
  
    * reprocessed versions of the material contained in the original version;

    * in the document directory: the Cassini_UVIS_Ring_Occultation_Atlas, an eight volume document that 
      contains tabular lists of all UVIS stellar occultations including the star name, rev number, indication of 
      ingress (I) or egress (E), date of the occultation, duration of the occultation, radial range 
      coverage and elevation angle of the star. In addition, for each occultation there are plots 
      showing the occultation geometry and raw signal vs. radius.

    * Details of the data processing involved in the production of this data set are provided in COLWELLETAL2010.

<p></p>
  * **VIMS Version 2 includes:** 
  
    * reprocessed versions of the material contained in the original version;

    * in the document directory: the VIMS_ring_occultations_summary, a multi-page  
      table with an additional two pages of notes and explanations. The table lists all VIMS stellar 
      occultations including star name, rev number, the observation start time, and several additional 
      parameters, as well as notes providing a subjective assessment of the overall quality of each occultation; 

    * in the browse directory: a set of four preview files for each occultation providing medium-resolution 
      plots of the viewing geometry, mean signal and optical depth vs. radius. 

    * Details of the data processing involved in the production of this data set are provided in 
      VIMS-occultation-processing.txt in the document directory, and in NICHOLSONETAL2019.

<strong>1/17/19 Version 2 of the RSS dataset [CORSS_8001](/link/volumes/CORSS_8xxx/CORSS_8001/) is available online.</strong> 

  * **RSS Version 2 includes:** 
    * reprocessed versions of the material contained in the earlier version, 
    * plus all subsequent RSS occultations obtained prior to the loss of the Cassini UltraStable Oscillator (USO) in late 2011.
    * 'DLP' files for each observation which contain higher resolution calibrated but diffraction-limited optical depth and phase shift profiles of Saturn's rings, that is, calibrated profiles before reconstruction to remove diffraction effects.
    * While Version 1 contained only X band data files. Version 2 contains K, S, and X band data.
    * Details of the data processing involved in the production of this data set are provided in MAROUFETAL1986.

## Voyager

We have three data sets of ring occultation profiles from Voyager instruments
(PPS, UVS, and RSS). The RSS data have not completed peer review. ** Users
should exercise caution when using the Voyager RSS occultation data.**

In addition, we have a small data set of Saturn ring radial profiles,
generated from the finest resolution Voyager ISS images.

  * **PPS** \- Browse the data set on-line [VG_2801](/link/volumes/VG_28xx/VG_2801/), or download the entire data set [VG_2801 tar.gz](/link/archives-volumes/VG_28xx/VG_2801.tar.gz). 
  * **UVS** \- Browse the data set on-line [VG_2802](/link/volumes/VG_28xx/VG_2802/), or download the entire data set [VG_2802 tar.gz](/link/archives-volumes/VG_28xx/VG_2802.tar.gz). 
  * **RSS** \- Browse the data set on-line [VG_2803](/link/volumes/VG_28xx_peer_review/VG_2803/), or download the entire data set [VG_2803 tar.gz](/link/archives-volumes/VG_28xx_peer_review/VG_2803.tar.gz). 
  * **ISS** \- Browse the data set on-line [VG_2810](/link/volumes/VG_28xx/VG_2810/), or download the entire data set [VG_2810 tar.gz](/link/archives-volumes/VG_28xx/VG_2810.tar.gz). 

Details about each of the instruments are available from our [Voyager
information pages](/voyager/).

# Earth-Based Ring Occultations

## Saturn

We have a single volume of Earth-based, Saturn stellar occultations. It
contains six small data sets from the July 1989 occultation of the bright star
28 Sgr by Saturn's rings. Each data set contains observations from a single
telescope. The telescopes are the European Southern Observatory's 1 meter
telescope, the European Southern Observatory's 2.2 meter telescope, the IRTF,
the Lick 1 meter telescope, the McDonald 2.7 meter telescope, and the Palomar
200 inch telescope.

  * Browse the data sets on-line [EBROCC_0001](/link/volumes/EBROCC_xxxx/EBROCC_0001/), or download the entire six data set volume [EBROCC_0001 tar.gz](/link/archives-volumes/EBROCC_xxxx/EBROCC_0001.tar.gz).
