<h1>Cassini RSS, UVIS, and VIMS Ring Occultations Peer Reviews</h1>
Mitch Gordon and Mark Showalter<br>
August 1, 2013

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
These three data sets contain derived, optical depth profiles of the 
rings of Saturn along with supporting documentation. The data sets have 
similar organization, and the primary data file contents are as parallel as
makes sense considering the differences in the instruments and the data 
they obtain.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The UVIS data was submitted first. 
</li>

<p></p>
<li>Subsequent to the submission of the UVIS data, the Rings Node prepared a 
	white paper of occultation keywords, refining definitions of terms in 
	common usage and introducing new terms. The white paper was reviewed by 
	all three teams and a few additional reviewers. 
	<p>
		The white paper also established guidelines for what keywords were required
		in labels and what minimum set of parameters should be included in a 
		ring occultation data file.
	</p>
	<p>The white paper is included in the DOCUMENT sub-directory in each data set.
</li>

<p></p>
<li>The UVIS data set, coupled with the white paper, served as a model for organization and contents of the 
	RSS and VIMS data sets.
</li>

<p></p>
<li>Because the UVIS data was submitted prior to the white paper, it does not
	include all of the fields required by the white paper in either its data labels 
	or occulation profile data files. The team has agreed to regenerate the data files 
	and provide the additional label file keyword values after the peer review. 
</li>

<p></p>
<li><b>For a complete list of known issues for each of the data sets, see the errata.txt file in 
		the root directory of that data set.</b>
