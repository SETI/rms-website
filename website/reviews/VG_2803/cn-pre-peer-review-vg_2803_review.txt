There        are a whole bunch of errors in the REF.CAT file.  It is easier and         will take less time to just edit your REF.CAT than it will be to         document all the errors.  See the new REF.CAT attached.                However . . . do need clarification on the following:(4b)    ANDERSONETAL1987A        This reference is already in the data dictionary as ANDERSONETAL1987B.        Two differences between what is already ingested and what is on volume:        (1)     Volume reference, "...Preliminary Results..."                Ingested reference, "...Results..." ("Preliminary" missing)        (2)     Volume reference, "...and 5 Principal..."                Ingested reference, "...and Five Principal..."        Check title to see if "Preliminary" is in title and if "5" is a digit        or spelled out.(4c)    ANDERSONETAL1987B        This reference is already in the data dictionary as ANDERSONETAL1987.        Two differenced between what is already ingested and what is on        volume.  Need to find out correct citation and ingest that one.                (1)     Authors are different between two citations, all names are                there in both, but order is different.        (2)     Ingested reference has page numbers as "L141-L143" and volume                reference has page numbers as "141-143".  Which is correct?        Check order of author names and page numbers.(4d)    BIRDETAL1997        Reference in data dictionary is imporperly formed, (i.e. words in        title that should be capitalized are not).

The reference on this volume is        missing a space.
