VG_2803 Review
==============

- Does not seem to be ISO_9660 compliant. I had some trouble opening files
  directly from the CD. It worked when I copied the files onto hard disk 
  though.

RESPONSE: We cannot reproduce this error. We will ensure ISO compliance when
we submit to the NSSDC.

- S_RINGS/RAWDATA/RS*R1BFV.LBL have erroneous ^STRUCTURE pointers. Should
  point to RS_R1BFV.FMT instead of RS_R1BFT.FMT.

RESPONSE: Fixed.

- U_RINGS/EASYDATA/KM00_025 has 94 labels that are missing their .TAB files.

RESPONSE: Fixed. These label files had been placed in the wrong directory.

- CATALOG/REF.CAT has non-ASCII characters in NICHOLSONETAL1990 entry.
  (The same characters appear in DOCUMENT/TUTORIAL.TXT line 895.)

RESPONSE: Fixed.

- DOCUMENT/TUTORIAL.TXT has TAB characters in lines 794, 798, 801, and 802.

RESPONSE: Fixed.

- *TIME label values should remove the trailing Z.

RESPONSE: Fixed.

- You have some files with the extension .FIT. While this is not a reserved
  extension, you might have some users who will think it's a FITS file.

RESPONSE: Good point. These are binary files and have been renamed to ".DAT".
