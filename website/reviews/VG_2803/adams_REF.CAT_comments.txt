***** References *****(4a)	Per the Standards, PDS uses the AGU format for references.  There	are a whole bunch of errors in the REF.CAT file.  It is easier and 	will take less time to just edit your REF.CAT than it will be to 	document all the errors.  See the new REF.CAT attached.		However . . . do need clarification on the following:(4b)	ANDERSONETAL1987A	This reference is already in the data dictionary as ANDERSONETAL1987B.	Two differences between what is already ingested and what is on volume:	(1)	Volume reference, "...Preliminary Results..."		Ingested reference, "...Results..." ("Preliminary" missing)	(2)	Volume reference, "...and 5 Principal..."		Ingested reference, "...and Five Principal..."	Check title to see if "Preliminary" is in title and if "5" is a digit	or spelled out.(4c)	ANDERSONETAL1987B	This reference is already in the data dictionary as ANDERSONETAL1987.	Two differenced between what is already ingested and what is on	volume.  Need to find out correct citation and ingest that one.		(1)	Authors are different between two citations, all names are		there in both, but order is different.	(2)	Ingested reference has page numbers as "L141-L143" and volume		reference has page numbers as "141-143".  Which is correct?	Check order of author names and page numbers.(4d)	BIRDETAL1997	Reference in data dictionary is imporperly formed, (i.e. words in	title that should be capitalized are not).  Volume reference is 	correct.  Re-ingest.(4e)	BENNER1997, BURATTI1997, CUNNINGHAM1997, CUZZIETAL1984	In data dictionary and this volume as . . .	BENNER1997		"...in Encyclopedia of Planetary Sciences, J.H.

Tyler", this volume has "G.L. Tyler".	Which is correct? (Note: LINDALETAL1981 and LINDALETAL1983 has "G.	L. Tyler", so that one is probably correct.  His name is coming up	a lot.
