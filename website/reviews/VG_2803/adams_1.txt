Did the nitty-grittystuff.  Still want to run some label and keyword tools.  I'm sendingcomments now because I have to be out tomorrow morning for a med test.Won't have a chance to run the tools until tomorrow afternoon.  Willsend the results of those when finished (hopefully, sometime Fridayafternoon).  As always, let me know if any "problems" with what I'vefound.-StevenMark Showalter wrote:Steve,If I hear back from you some time next week, that'll be fine.

For further			     to:			     	of computer systems (e.g., Sun, HP, Macintosh, PC). For further		(my little "pet project", proper usage of exempli gratia 		and id est)	B.	line 83, HTML link invalid.  Change to:		http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/sr/index.html			or the more general:		http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/	C.	line 137, HTML link is invalid.  Change to:		http://pds-naif.jpl.nasa.gov/	D.	lines 210-223, ASCII representation of directory structure.		Not all of the subdirectories you list here are on the		volume and there are some subdirectories on the volume		that are not listed.  Edit the file to more accurately 		represent the volume.		(If light of above, upon further investigation, I think I 		figured out what you did.  If I were you, just duplicate		the U_RINGS directory structure and paste it under the 		S_RINGS directory; then edit to represent actual.)2.	\ROOT\ERRATA.TXT	A.	line 21, change: ...words, e.g.			     to: ...words, e.g.,	B.	End of file.  Just another one of my "pet projects".  I		often wonder when reading a ERRATA.TXT file if part of the		file got cut off.  There is no definitive terminator to		let a reader know that s/he arrived at the end of the file.		I've really wondered this when reading some ERRATA.TXT		files that have all the header "stuff", then a header		beginning the sections of "known errors or deviations",		then, just a blank line before the end of the file.		So . . . I like to add <eof> on the last line.  Just like		this file.  Your choice.  Of course, not required or even		a recommendation of CN or PDS.3.	\ROOT\VOLDESC.CAT	A.	no issues, looks okay		Note: since we already ingested the VOLDESC and the other		catalog files, I just made a quick cursory check of them.4.	\DOCUMENT\	A.	ATLAS.PDF and ATLNOTES.PDF		PDS standards require ASCII versions of all document files.		(Between you and I, and don't tell anyone else here at CN,		just make a notation in the ERRATA.TXT that ASCII versions		of these two files are not available, not practical to		convert, etc. and leave them as is.  Maybe give a link to		a PDF reader that can be downloaded, but then, there is the		issue of NASA endorsing a commercial product.)		(Update after viewing the above two files.  ATLAS.PDF		cannot be converted to ASCII text.  But, then the argument		can be made about converting them to an image of some type,		such as GIF or JPG.  An case can be made for providing an		ASCII version of ATLNOTES.PDF, but the math formulas would		have to be address some how.  My recommendations is as		above, (i.e., make a notation in the ERRATA.TXT and leave		them as is).)	B.	RS1S_DOC.TXT		1.	lines 15-18, 'N/A'???					Didn't this come up on VG_2802.  What did you 			decide to do? I think you said that you agreed this 			was old notation, but not technically wrong and 			that for new volumes, you will use quotes instead 			of apostrophies.		2.	lines 104 and 119, add a comma after id est			use    i.e.,    instead of    i.e.		3.	line 651, lower case exempli gratia and add comma			use    e.g.,    instead of    E.g.		4.	line 109, double occurance of "the", delete one of			them.		5.	line 269, capitalize "ascii"		C.	RS2S_DOC.TXT, RS3S_DOC.TXT, and RS4S_DOC.TXT		1.	Same three issues as above in the RS1S_DOC.TXT 			file, (except the line numbers are a little 			different on two of the files).		2.	RS4S_DOC.TXT			a.	line 106, double occurance of "the", delete				one.			b.	line 273, capitalize "ascii"		3.	RS3S_DOC.TXT			a.	as above (4.C.3.a.)			b.	as above (4.C.3.b.), but line number 277		4.	RS2S_DOC.TXT			a.	as above (4.C.3.a.), but line number 109			b.	as above (4.C.3.b.), but line number 268	D.	TUTORIAL.TXT		1.	line 63, id est again		2.	line 251, hyperlink invalid (see 1.C. above for			correct link)		3.	lines 572-575, and line 621, 'N/A' again		4.	line 660, hyperlink invalid (see 1.B. above for			correct link)		5.	line 895, illegal æ ASCII characters on this line	E.	POLES.TXT		1.	line 93, change: etal's				     to: et al's5.	\INDEX\	A.	INDEX.LBL		1.	line 61, change: BYTES = 6				     to: BYTES = 12		2.	line 113, change: BYTES = 16				      to: BYTES = 15		(start byte counts are correct, just the width of the two		fields mentioned above)6.	NOTE: Didn't spend much time with your data directories.  They've	been pretty clean on your prev VG_xxxx volumes, so spent my limited	time on label verification and keyword/value pair validation.7.	<eof>
