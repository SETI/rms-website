Mitch,

Attached are my comments.  I'll keep looking,
but don't expect to find much more.  All in all,
pretty clean.  Data looks fine.  If I have any
additional comments, will mention them in the
morning at the telecon.  Talk with you then.

Validation coments below apply to all 'volumes' of disk

0.	general 'volume' comments

	root level files/ - CATALOG - DOCUMENT - INDEX/SUMDARKS.*

	A.	These files are the same across ALL 'volumes'.  
		Should this be so?

		Expecially the VOLDESC.CAT files?  Considering the
		VOLUME_NAME and VOLUME_ID keywords on the different
		'volumes'.

1.	root level files

	A.	AAREADME.TXT

		1.	Section 4.4 DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

			a.	ASCII directory tree in the AAREADME.TXT 
				does not match the directory structure on 
				the volumes

	B.	ERRATA.TXT

		1.	typo, line 21, change "e.g." to "e.g.,"

	C.	VOLDESC.CAT

		1.	lines 7 and 8,

			VOLUME_SET_ID = USA_NASA_PDS_VGISS_0001_TO_VGISS_0038
			VOLUMES       = 38

			However, 'volumes' 1 through 3 and 6 through 25 are
			'missing'.  There are not 38 'volumes'.

		2.	line 10,

			VOLUME_ID = "VGISS_0004"

			Same VOLUME_ID for all 'volumes' on this disk.

		3.	line 22,

			INSTITUTION_NAME = "SETI INSTITUTE"

			Keyword is of type DYNAMIC and will require an 
			update to the data dictionary for the inclusion of 
			"SETI INSTITUTE".

		4.	line 23,

			FACILITY_NAME = "SETI INSTITUTE"

			As above, 3.D.

		5.	line 37,

			^INSTRUMENT_HOST_CATALOG = {"VG1HOST.CAT", "VG2HOST.CAT"}

			VG1WINST.CAT and VG2WINST.CAT on volume, but not 
			listed in the ^INSTRUMENT_HOST_CATALOG keyword 
			pointer

2.	/CATALOG/ directory files

	A.	missing CATINFO.TXT file

	B.	PERSON.CAT

		1.	lines 14, 40, and 66,

			INSTITUTION_NAME = "SETI INSTITUTE"

			"SETI INSTITUTE", not a standard value, will need
			to be added to the data dictionary

		2.	line 120,

			INSTITUTION_NAME = "U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY"

			"U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY" is not a standard value,
			change to the following, existing standard value,

			"UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY"

		3.	line 37 and line 39,

			Same phone number listed for Mitch's voice phone
			and facsimile number.  Is this correct?  This is
			as it is currently in the data dictionary.

	C.	DATASET.CAT

		1.	line 24+,
		
			a.	ABSTRACT_TEXT = "blah, blah, blah"

				ABSTRACT_TEXT is a 'boo boo' keyword and 
				should have never been added to the data 
				dictionary. The required keyword, 
				ABSTRACT_DESC is missing from this 
				DATA_SET_INFORMATION object.

				Rename ABSTRACT_TEXT to ABSTRACT_TEXT and 
				all will be well.

			b.	Make appropriate change in
				/DOCUMENT/PDSDD.TXT

		2.	line 13

			ARCHIVE_STATUS = "PEER REVIEW"
			
			Correct keyword value should be one of the
			following, as appropriate for the current status
			of the dataset:
			
			ARCHIVE_STATUS = "PRE PEER REVIEW"
			ARCHIVE_STATUS = "IN PEER REVIEW"
			ARCHIVE_STATUS = "IN LIEN RESOLUTION"

			Or, whatever value is appropriate.  "PEER REVIEW"
			is not a valid value for this keyword.

		3.	line 487-489,

			REFERENCE_KEY_ID = "JGRV88"
			
			This reference is not listed in the REF.CAT file
			of this volume.

	D.	REF.CAT

		1.	lines 158 - 160

			missing valid REFERENCE_KEY_ID and REFERENCE_DESC
			keyword/value pair.

			Current REFERENCE_KEY_ID value should really 
			be the REFERENCE_DESC value, and the correct 
			REFERENCE_KEY_ID is missing.

		2.	Add JGRV88 to the file.  It is referenced by the
			DATASET.CAT file, but not included in the REF.CAT
			file.

		3.	Two listings of SCIENCEV206N4421 exist in this file.
			First listing at lines 141-146 is correct, second
			listing at lines 162-165 is incorrect.  Remove the
			second listing from the file.

		4.	SCIENCEV233N4759

			This reference is listed in VG1NINST.CAT, 
			VG2NINST.CAT, VG1WINST.CAT, AND VG2WINST.CAT files
			in the 'OBJECT = INSTRUMENT_REFERENCE_INFO', but is
			not listed in the REF.CAT file, (nor in the body of
			the respective INST.CAT files).

			Either delete OBJECT from the four instrument files,
			(as they are not referenced within the file), or add
			to the REF.CAT file.

		5.	SCIENCEV246N4936

			As above, 2.D.4.

		6.	SIS4-7008-2

			This reference is listed in the DATASET.CAT file in
			the 'OBJECT = INSTRUMENT_REFERENCE_INFO', but is
			not listed in the REF.CAT file, (nor in the body of
			file).

			Either delete the OBJECT from the DATASET.CAT file,
			(as it is not referenced within the file), or add
			to the REF.CAT file.

	E.	VG1WINST.CAT and VG2WINST.CAT

		1.	Please add a more complete LABEL_REVISION_NOTE,
			(instead of the perfectly valid, but uninspired,
			"NULL").

		2.	lines 835-837,

			REFERENCE_KEY_ID = "SNYDER,L1979"

			Ill-formed keyword value, could not decipher what it
			should have been, but since no SNYDER references are
			refered to within the file, perhaps just delete this
			object.

3.	/DOCUMENT/ directory

	A.	PDSDD.TXT

		1.	change 'NAME = ABSTRACT_TEXT' to 'ABSTRACT_DESC'
			and make appropriate text changes to description.

	B.	PROCESSING.TXT

		1.	line 25,

			Referenced file, DOCUMENT/VICAR.TXT, does not 
			exist on this volume.  Should it be: 
			DOCUMENT/VICAR_ASC/TXT?

	C.	VICAR.LBL

		1.	line 3, ^ASCII_DOCUMENT = "VICAR.ASC"
		
			Change "VICAR.ASC"
			To	"VICAR.ASC.TXT"

		2.	^HTML_DOCUMENT = ("VICAR.HTML",
                                          "VICAR001.GIF",
                                          "VICAR002.GIF",
                                          "VICAR003.GIF")

			line 32, OBJECT - HTML_DOCUMENT
			but, GIF files are not HTML files, but image files.
			Should be GIF_DOCUMENT (see PDS stds, section 9.1.2)

	D.	TUTORIAL.TXT

		1.	typo, line 81, change "i.e." to "i.e.,"

	E.	VICAR.ASC.TXT

		1.	typo, lines 62 and 196, change "e.g." to "e.g.,"

		2.	typo, lines 109, 111, 497, and 549,
			change "i.e." to "i.e.,"

4.	/INDEX/ directory

	A.	Why is CUMINDEX only on VGISS_0038 and not the others?

5.	/data/ directories

	A.	DATAINFO.TXT files refer to /DOCUMENTS/ directory as the
		location of the PROCESSING.TXT file.  This should be listed
		as the /DOCUMENT/ directory (singular, not plural).  (Last
		paragraph of each file.)
