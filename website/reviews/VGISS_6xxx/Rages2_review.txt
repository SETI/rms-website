I see you're using the standard calibration for the WA MeJ filter:

ABSOLUTE CALIBRATION NOT GOOD,SHADING CORRECTION ONLY WAS DONE
                         PICTURE MULTIPLIED BY    3.35      FICOR 2/02/86 VERSION
                        SCALE='SATURN '

I suppose this gets into philosophy, but everybody who was there now knows the standard calibration factor for that filter was about 30% low.  Maybe you have a copy of the "New Calibration Factors" memo from Torrance Johnson dated 8-18-89 (i.e. Neptune encounter), which gives  4.782  for this (VGR2) filter.

So do you go with ABSOLUTE CALIBRATION NOT GOOD and a factor you know should be increased by ~50%, or do you put in a value you know is better, but is less well documented?
