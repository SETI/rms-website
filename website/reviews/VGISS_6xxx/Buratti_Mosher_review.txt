Recommendations:

1) The disk should be organized by target body, not by CDROM  
volume. I wanted to copy all the Iapetus images and had to hunt for  
the Iapetus directories and change directory several times in order  
to copy the files.

2) All the documentation should be in one directory and not  
duplicated in many directories. Reference is made to the Voyager  
Calibration Report. This document could be easily scanned and  
included on the disk as could other documents.

3) The disk needs a picture catalog to help the user select the  
images he wants to use. The disk also needs SEDR data to help with  
further processing.

4) It would be handy to have an file of each image in a common  
computer format, like jpg or gif.

5) It would be handy to include some Voyager-specific NAIF routines  
and kernels if space permits. There was 27GB of free space on the  
hard drive.
