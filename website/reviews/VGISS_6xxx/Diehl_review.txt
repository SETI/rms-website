Dear Mitch,

I have completed my review of the Voyager volumes.

On every volume, there was no CATINFO.TXT file in the DOCUMENT
sub-directory.  This is required.

On every volume there was no cumulative index.  This is required.

As far as the format of the files. I have attached a zipped tar file
with what I found on each volume.  The file names on the tar file are
of the form testlinVgIssxx, where the xx inidcates the volume number
for which the comments are intended.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

John Diehl
