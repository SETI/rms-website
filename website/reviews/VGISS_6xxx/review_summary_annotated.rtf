Many of the comments appear to arise from files corrupted in the transfer. \{mg\}\par \par }{\cf2 This was our first experience with distributing a 160-Gb data set and it is clear that we need to refine the process. PDS in general is well aware of issues surrounding data integrity, but we cut corners at the Rings Node because of the amount of time it was taking to create so many disks. All corruption issues arose during the duplication process; we are confident that the copies held at the Rings Node are OK. We apologize for the inconvenience some of you encountered.\par }{\b \par }{2.\tab Strong desire by two reviewers \{ca, kr\} to correct target misidentification in labels inherited from the previous data set.\par \par }{\cf2 We did correct some target identifications, and we will update any other errors that are identified.  However, be aware that most target identifications were provided by the Voyager ISS team, and we have no obvious method for correcting their errors short of examining every image.\par \par We will add warnings to ERRATA.TXT, AAREADME.TXT and anywhere else that is appropriate asking that any identified target errors be reported to the Rings Node. We propose to issue index updates on line if future errors are identified.  \par \par Is this an acceptable approach to dealing with misidentified targets? }{\cf6 Yes}{\f0\cf2 .}{\cf2 \par }{\par 3.\tab Two reviewers \{ca, jm\} questioned the utility of paralleling the original file structure and naming conventions. One \{ca\} points out that file naming constraints have changed. One \{bb-jm\} requested that the archive be organized as a single data set, not by CDROM volume. \par \par }{\cf2 We checked with the Engineering Node about appropriate volume sizes, and the consensus is that a current, practical limit is ~10 Gbytes. For this reason, we have concluded that issuing the data set as a single logical volume remains impractical.\par \par Nevertheless, we agree that the file organization may be worth re-thinking. Most modern PDS data sets are organized by time, not target. It would be relatively easy to reorganize the volumes in this manner. This would also mitigate the problems that arise from the confusing directory tree structure and those that arise when a misidentified target places a file in the wrong directory.\par \par Is there a consensus of the review panel that we should undertake this reorganization? }{\cf6 Yes.}{\cf2 \par \par Note that most users obtain Voyager data via downloads from the PDS, not physical volumes. (The Rings Node's existing catalog distributes raw Voyager images, but a much more powerful catalog is in development.) Such a download system tends to make the precise path to a file irrelevant. Does on-line availabililty reduce the need for the proposed reorganization?\par }{\par 4.\tab Two reviewers \{me, kr\} noted that while reseau removal is generally good, it can introduce glaring anomalies when the reseau is near a boundary between 'bright' and 'dark' areas of an image. One reviewer \{me\} proposed that either the reseaus not be removed, or that additional versions of the 'CLEANED',  'GEOMED' and 'CALIB' images be included that have the reseaus left intact.\par \par }{\cf2 Mark finds that reseau removal is generally beneficial. For example, photometry of a bland region is much simpler if you don't have to mask out or overwrite potentially hundreds of black dots. However, it is certainly true that VICAR's reseau removal algorithm leaves much to be desired, particularly near abrupt brightness transitions.\par \par Each image in the data set is accompanied by a file *GEOMA.TAB that provides the "before" and "after" coordinates of each reseau marking. Hence, a quick check of the table should always enable the user to find out if a feature is a reseau or not.\par \par Perhaps we have not highlighted these files sufficently in our documentation, in which case the problem could be easily remedied.\par \par The alternative is to to include nearly identical images but with the reseau markings intact. However, this would essentially double the size of an already large data set. Does the review panel believe that these additional versions of the files are needed?}{\f0\cf2  }{\cf6 No.}{\cf2 \par }{\par 5.\tab One reviewer \{bb-jm\} recommends a browse directory.\par \par }{\cf2 Browse directories for these volumes would be effectively the same as the browse directories that already exist on the original PDS volumes---smaller versions of all the images. This is the reason we opted to leave them out.\par \par Our expectation is that on-line catalogs will have the capability to provide preview of images, in the process of a user's search through these extensive collections. Most of PDS's on-line catalogs, including those at the Rings Node and Imaging Node's, provide this capability.\par \par Does the review panel believe that we should add browse directories to the archived volumes? }{\f0\cf6 Yes \endash  separate browse directory, one browse for each FDS probably based on the cleaned image.}{\par \par 6.\tab \lquote The archive needs a picture catalog to help the user select images.\rquote  \{bb-jm\}\par \par }{\cf2 We are not entirely clear on what is meant by a picture catalog. Perhaps it is something like our image browsing tool for Cassini ISS. See\par       http://pds-rings.seti.org/browse/COISS_1002/data/1351738505_1351858128/\par for an example. (We note that this particular image browsing system is not currently up to date.)\par \par Is this the sort of picture catalog that one would want?  If yes, is it acceptable for it to exist on-line rather than on the archival volumes?}{\f0\cf2   }{\f0\cf6 INDEX.TAB files address this.}{\cf6 \par }{\par 7.\tab Two reviewers \{me\}, \{bb-jm\}, requested SEDR data, NAIF kernels, and Voyager specific SPICE routines be included.\par \par }{\cf2 Mark is happy to report that a reconstructed C-kernel for the Voyager 1 Saturn encounter is nearly complete. This corrects many (but perhaps not all) of the largest pointing errors in the original SEDR. The Voyager 2 C-kernel should follow shortly.\par \par We agree in the importance of geometric information and would like to find a workable solution for providing it with the data set.  Here are some possible solutions, in order from easiest to hardest:\par \par (a) Add the derived C kernels (pointing information) and also to SP kernels (ephemeris and trajectory information) to the data volumes.\par \par (b) Derive tables of pointing, position and velocity information and add them to the volumes (in addition to the kernels).\par \par (c) Incorporate the tables of geometry information into the existing INDEX.TAB files rather than including them as separate files. (Note that the INDEX files repeat information for each type of file---RAW, CLEANED, etc.---so this would be a less efficient solution.)\par \par (d) Add the relevant geometry information to each label file.\par \par Note that all geometry information is approximate and it will always be possible for errors to arise after the volume is published. This means that the Rings Node will need to maintain an up-to-date index, and possibly revised kernels, on line.\par \par What is the panel's recommended solution?}{\f0\cf2   }{\f0\cf6 (a), (c), (d)}{\cf6 \par }{\f0\cf6 Work with EN \endash  mimimal index.tab containing every file, image-index with information for each image (not each version of each image) including pointing information.

Possibly because JUPITER calibration was set in FICOR. \{kr\}\par \par }{\cf2 Dark currents were chosen via an automated procedure that identified the one with matching camera and scan rate taken closest in time to the image being calibrated. The selection is listed in the PDS label as the second entry under SOURCE_PRODUCT_ID. At least based on the criteria specified above, the dark currents chosen for Kathy's four bad images appear to be reasonable. However, Mark has also identified a few other images for which the dark current was not very good. Please let us know if any other images were found with questionable dark currents or other calibration parameters. We will investigate the source of the problem.\par \par By the way, FICOR77 adds SCALE='JUPITER' to the VICAR header of EVERY Voyager 1 image. We correct for this in our own calibration but it is certainly confusing to anyone reading the VICAR header. We will need to address this in our documentation so as to minimize confusion. We propose to discuss this, and any other quirks of the VICAR headers, in TUTORIAL.TXT, PROCESSING.TXT and/or ERRATA.TXT.\par \par However, it is not our policy to change information in the VICAR headers. FICOR77 does not have scaling for Voyager 2 at Saturn, so the information in the header is accurate, if somewhat bizarre. \par \par Nevertheless, Kathy's issue is a serious one because it raises the issue of whether this data set should or should not pass peer review. Our goal is to calibrate the Voyager images one last time, so that no one every has to calibrate them again. We do not regard 4/8 as a successful track record. We will attempt to understand what step in the procedures went wrong and will re-process any images that need to be re-processed. Further comments are welcome.
