Becausethis volume will be distributed primarily on line, I suspect thisproblem will not affect most users.>- VECTORS/B1950/US2VE1LB.L and VECTORS/J2000/US2VE1LB.L should be>  US2VE1.LBL.

I deleted them.Also I noticed that several .LBL files had missing .TAB files in theVECTORS/J2000 directory. They have been inserted now.>- CATALOG/REF.CAT has non-ASCII characters in NICHOLSONETAL1990 entry.Fixed.  Very strange.>- RAWDATA/RAWDATAP.FMT has missing CR/LF at line 619.Fixed.>- *TIME label values should remove the trailing Z.In general I agree.  We never use the Z.  In a global search, the onlyline I found is an example in the file SOFTWARE/OAL/L3GUIDE.TXT. Since Ididn't write this file, it's only an example, and is not formallyincorrect, I decided not to change it.>- AAREADME.TXT, lines 429-430 are confusing.The copy-paste error has been fixed.>- In many labels you have the value 'N/A', I believe the preferred method>  is "N/A".Yes, "N/A" is now preferred.  I have made this change globally.>- You have some files with the extension .FIT. While this is not a reserved>  extension, you might have some users who will think it's a FITS file.These files have been renamed from *.FIT to *F.TAB.  I have also updatedthe documentation that refers to these files.>- In the DOCUMENT directory, you have several labels that have >  ^ASCII_DOCUMENT that point to all of the Postscript figures in addition>  to the ASCII text. I would discourage this usage.

What we have here,unfortunately, is a document consisting of an ASCII text file plus a setof Postscript figures.  The current PDS DOCUMENT object cannot handle amixture of formats in a single document. For what it's worth, thePostscript files really are 100% ASCII so treating them as ASCII, notbinary, causes no harm. The Central Node did not raise any issues aboutthis particular label so I assume it is good enough, under thecircumstances, pending the completion of the new PDS DOCUMENT structure.
