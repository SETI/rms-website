AAREADME.TXT>>	A.	Line 94, HTML link is invalid.  Change to:>>		http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/sr/index.html>>		or the more general:>>		http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/Done.>	B.	line 150, HTML link is invalid.  Change to:>>		http://pds-naif.jpl.nasa.gov/Done.>	C.	ASCII tree of dir structure looks very nice.>>2.	VOLDESC.CAT>>	A.	Change: FACILITY_NAME = "SPACE SCIENCE DIVISION">	            To: FACILITY_NAME = "SPACE SCIENCE LABORATORY">>		This was noted on the orig validation.  SSD is not listed>		as a standard value while SSL is listed."SPACE SCIENCE DIVISION" is the correct name.  I understand this is nowbeing added to the list of standard values.  We have not made thischange.>3.	\TRAJECT\*.*>>	A.	Capitalize filenames and filename extensions in this>		directory.  All other directories and sub-directories>		okay.Done.>4.	\CATALOG\DATASET.CAT>>	A.	The catalog files on this volume ingested the other week.>		Just as an advisory . . . CURATING_NODE_ID is now a required >		keyword for a DATASET.CAT file.>		>		In this case, we used CURATING_NODE_ID = RINGSAdded to the DATA_SET_INFORMATION object.>	B.	DATA_SET_INFORMATION object missing required element,>		ABSTRACT_DESC.Added to the DATA_SET_INFORMATION object. It's just a duplicate of theDATA_SET_TERSE_DESC because I don't understand the difference betweenthe two.>	C.	Existing standard value for ARCHIVE_STATUS is >		IN PEER REVIEW, not IN_PEER_REVIEW, (no underscores).Noted.  However this has now been changed to "ARCHIVED".>5.	\CATALOG\CATINFO.TXT>>	A.	line 33 - change "INSTHOST.CAT" to "VG1HOST.CAT" and>		"VG2HOST.CAT".  There is no "INSTHOST.CAT" on the volume>		or in this directory.Done.>6.	\CATALOG\SOFTWARE.CAT>>	A.	There is a "problem" with the PROTOCOL_TYPE element in >		several of the SOFTWARE_ONLINE objects in this file.  The>		PROTOCOL_TYPE element has a STD_VAL_TYPE = STATIC, which>		means that new standard values must be approved by CN>		before they can be used.  So far, there are only two>		standard values for this keyword, those being URL and FTP.>		You want to use three new ones.  These are; "COMPRESSED" for>		OALV13.TAR.Z, "SOURCE" for lablib3.c, and "COMPRESSED TAR">		for LABLIB3.TAR.Z.>>		You can make a good case for using two of the three you>		want to use.  But, "COMPRESSED" and "COMPRESSED TAR" is>		somewhat redundant.  Both refer to tar files.  Pick one or>		the other to use, not both.I have corrected the PROTOCOL_TYPE. I have also filled in the missing URLfor the Rings Node tools.>7.	\SOFTWARE\OAL\*>>	A.	Change filename \SOFTWARE\OAL\AAREADME.TXT to>		\SOFTWARE\OAL\xxxxINFO.TXT (where xxxx is the appropriate >		name, (perhaps OALINFO.TXT?)).>>	B.	Change filename \SOFTWARE\OAL\EXAMPLES\README.TXT to>		\SOFTWARE\OAL\EXAMPLES\xxxxINFO.TXT (where xxxx is the>		appropriate name, (perhaps EXAMINFO.TXT?)).>>	C.	\SOFTWARE\OAL\IDL\README.TXT - as above.>>	D.	\SOFTWARE\PROFILE\AAREADME.TXT - as above.In fact I left most of these files alone but added brief, additionalSOFTINFO.TXT files.  That should solve the problem.>7.	There are no xxxxINFO.TXT files in the following non-data>	directories.>>	\SOFTWARE\OAL\FORTRAN>	\SOFTWARE\OAL\SOURCE>	\SOFTWARE\PROFILE\EXAMPLES>	\SOFTWARE\PROFILE\OALSRC>	\SOFTWARE\PROFILE\SOURCE>	\SPICE\IEEE		- but covered by \SPICE\DATAINFO.TXT>	\SPICE\PC		- but covered by \SPICE\DATAINFO.TXT>	\SPICE\TRANSFER		- but covered by \SPICE\DATAINFO.TXT>	\SPICE\VAXG		- but covered by \SPICE\DATAINFO.TXTAt great personal cost, all these directories now have *INFO.TXT files.>7.	\CATALOG\REF.CAT>>	A.	BROADFOOT&SANDEL1977>	>		Can you verify "Ssanacon"?  The ref is in the DD with this>		word spelled this way.  Is it correct?I don't have access to Applied Optics, but I note that this is thefull title:  REFERENCE_DESC                = "Broadfoot, A.L., and B.R. Sandel,Self-scanned anode array with a microchannel plate electronmultiplier: The Ssanacon, Applied Optics, 16, 1533 - 1538, 1977."I would guess that "Ssanacon" is an acronym: Self-Scanned ANode Array....OK, so after that I'm stumped.  But I think we can assume it's right.>10.	There are 72 label files with the string "of of", as in:>>	DESCRIPTION = "Radial distance of the occultation intercept point >	from the center of of the planet, in kilometers.>>	The second (or first) occurrence of the word "of" needs to be>	deleted.  This was noted in the orig validation as occurring in 122>	label files.  It appears that it has been fixed in some of them,>	but not all.Done. I've grepped through the whole directory tree and fixed everyoccurrence of "of of".>11.	\DOCUMENT\EDITDATA\DATA\IOTAHER3.LBL>>	A.	line 85, change: END_OBJECT = SERIES>			     to: END_OBJECT = TABLEFixed.  It's actually a series, not a table, so I made the opposite change.>12.	\GEOMETRY\US1G02.LBL>>	A.	line 12, 37, 57, 82 and 167>>			change: SOURCE_PRODUCT_ID = 'N/A'>			    to: SOURCE_PRODUCT_ID = "N/A"I made the global change from 'N/A' to "N/A".>13.	\RAWDATA\UN1R01I.LBL>>	A.	COLUMN is a required sub-object for the TABLE object.  It>		is missing from this file.>	>	B.	Also the following files in the \RAWDATA\ directory have>		this same "problem" as above (13.A.).>>		1.	UN1R01P.LBL		13.	US3R01ID.LBL>		2.	UN1R01V.LBL             14.	US3R01P.LBL >		3.	US1R01I.LBL             15.	US3R01PD.LBL>		4.	US1R01P.LBL             16.	US3R01V.LBL >		5.	US1R01V.LBL             17.	US3R01VD.LBL>		6.	US2R01I.LBL             18.	UU1R01I.LBL >		7.	US2R01ID.LBL            19.	UU1R01P.LBL >		8.	US2R01P.LBL             20.	UU1R01V.LBL >		9.	US2R01PD.LBL            21.	UU2R01I.LBL >		10.	US2R01V.LBL             22.	UU2R01P.LBL >		11.	US2R01VD.LB             23.	UU2R01V.LBL >		12.	US3R01I.LBlThe columns are actually defined in "include" files:OBJECT                          = TABLE  NAME                          = UVS_RAW_DATA  INTERCHANGE_FORMAT            = BINARY  ROWS                          = 18692  COLUMNS                       = 59  ROW_BYTES                     = 768  ^STRUCTURE                    = "RAWDATAI.FMT"Thanks for confirming that this approach is valid.>14.	\SORCDATA\>>	A.	Same "problem" (13.A., missing COLUMN sub-object) in the >		following files in this directory.>	>		1.	BETPER.LBL		5.	DELSCO.LBL>		2.	DELSCOI.LBL		6.	DELSCOID.LBL>		3.	IOTAHER.LBL		7.	IOTAHERD.LBL>		4.	SIGSAG_N.LBL		8.	SIGSAG_U.LBLAgain, these labels use included .FMT files to describe the columns.>15.	\SORCDATA\DELSCO1.LBL>>	A.	There are two START_TIME and STOP_TIME keyword/values in>		this file.  Only one allowed. (lines 19 and 23 are the two>		START_TIME and lines 20 and 24 the two STOP_TIME).Fixed.In the process, I also noticed erroneous dates: 1981-05 instead of1981-08, the month of the Voyager 2 Saturn encounter. I did a globalsearch and replacement of those dates.>16.	\RAWDATA\*.LBL (21 of the 24 label files in this directory have >	this "problem"/)>>	A.	EARTH_RECEIVED_START_TIME = NULL>		EARTH_RECEIVED_STOP_TIME = NULL>>		NULL is to be used when the value is temporarily unknown.>		UNK is to be used when the value is not known and never >		will be known.  In these label files, which is the case?>		If temporarily unknown, does that mean you will submit a>		new volume when the value is known?Clearly an Earth-received time occurred, but we don't know what it isand we don't know how to find out.  More to the point, it is of noreal significance to any user of the data.  So I think this is acorrect usage of NULL. Fear not, we have no intention of submitting anupdate.>17.	\SORCDATA\*.LBL>>	A.	Same "problem" as above (16.A.)Same response.>18.	\INDEX\INDEX.LBL>>	A.	Multiple instances of UNIT = 'N\A'>>		While technically correct, this is antiquated usage.  >		The "more proper" usage would be: UNIT = "N/A". (The>		apostrophe (single quote) has been replaced by quotes>		(double quotes).I've made this change globally.>19.	Data files and images look fine.  Not all files viewed, only a>	representative sample.  TBTOOL and NASAVIEW had no problems.Good. Thanks for checking.
