<h1>VG_2802 Peer Review Summary</h1>
Voyager UVS Ring Occultation Data Set<br>

<p>
Given the panel's consensus, this data set is now officially released.
The only changes from the "near_final" version of the data set were a few
syntax and editorial corrections.
<p>
The final version is now on line as a browsable directory
<a href="/cds/VG_2802/">VG_2802</a>
and as a single, downloadable zip file
<a href="/zips/VG_2802.zip">VG_2802.zip</a>. The previous versions have
been removed.  Thanks to one and all!

This data set is about to be delivered to the Central Node for 
final ingestion into the PDS. Thank you very much to the hardy 
souls who submitted peer reviews.
<p>
The near-final version is on line as an expanded directory tree
<a href="/cds/VG_2802_near_final/">VG_2802_near_final</a>
or as a single, downloadable zip file
<a href="/zips/VG_2802_near_final.zip">VG_2802_near_final.zip</a>.
<p>
It would be conventional to hold a telecon to discuss the data set and
all the reviewer comments.  However, in this case I have adopted
nearly every recommendation submitted by the review panel. In those
few cases where I did not do exactly what was recommended, I made
alternative changes that I think address the issue adequately. See
the detailed responses below.
<p>
I am hoping we can achieve a consensus that the data set is final and
avoid the (always difficult to schedule!) step of holding a telecon.
<p>
Please let me know if you find this acceptable.
