Any>corrections are welcome, including a total rewrite if you wish. >Otherwise I will assume that this is the final text of your peer>review for the UVS data set.>>I really do appreciate your help.>>Regards, Mark>>===================================================>>Overall, this appears to be a complete analysis and assessment of the>Voyager UVS ring occultation data.>>At Mark's request, Padma's focus was on the DOCUMENT/SPROFILE files. >Padma is unfamiliar with some of the processing steps described here. >She has reservations about the way Mark worked backward to retrieve>the separate star and background count values for the Saturn profile;>mainly she is unsure whether this is a unique solution or just one of>many that are equally plausible.I added further notes in SPROFILE.ASC and SPROFILE.PDF to make it clearwhy the calibration reconstruction is unique.>Most of Padma's UVS data files, including those that she used for her>thesis, were lost when an old computer was decommissioned. >Nevertheless, the optical depth values found on this volume are>consistent with values she used in her thesis research. Gaps that Mark>noted in the data files were the result of tape read errors.>>Padma referred Mark to a typed memo written by Jude Diner in the early>1980's that describes the usage of the "E parameter" in detail.  This>memo also makes the point that occultation error bars are not>symmetric.  Padma cannot find a hardcopy of this memo but believes>Phil Nicholson may have a copy somewhere.  Mark will try to find a>copy.I checked with Phil but he was unable to find the memo.
