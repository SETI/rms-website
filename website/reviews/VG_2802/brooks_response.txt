In the future, file names can bemuch more descriptive. Nevertheless, even in the Cassini occultationarchives, the only information embedded into file names to distinguishoccultations will be dates.  For the case of Voyager 2 at Uranus, bothoccultations were on the same day!Working under the 8.3 restriction, the best we could do is number theoccultations.  We did this consistently across all three Voyageroccultation data sets---PPS, UVS and RSS.  Also, the U was chosen sothat file names would be unique across all three data sets; PPS filesbegin with "P" and RSS files begin with "R". That was chosen because weexpected people to copy files off the CDs and work with them on theirown disk drives; we felt that a unique file name would be importantunder those circumstances.Because you present this as a reservation but not a show-stopper, andbecause the effort involved in renaming all the files would be enormous,I think we need to leave it unchanged.  However, we agree to use moreinformative names in future data sets.>	I would naively think that all of the programs that were used to>manipulate the raw data should be located under the SOFTWARE directory.  >I think they should be.

To us, it seemed to make more sense to keep all of theassociated files in one place.  As you realized, we did a lot of workanalyzing and re-formatting the data; it seemed important to include theprograms to serve as unambiguous documentation of what we did.Instead of the reorganization as you propose, I have added further notesin both the SOFTWARE and DOCUMENT directories to make it clear where tofind things and to explain why they are located at different places in thedirectory tree.  See SOFTWARE/SOFTINFO.TXT and DOCUMENT/DOCINFO.TXT.>	This is probably a minor point, but it was initially unclear to me>that ring opacity is used interchangeably with optical depth.

We havestarted to prefer the word "opacity" because "optical depth" is a bitof a misnomer in the context of radio occultations.  (I suppose thecorrect term there would be "radio depth".)I have done a global search and made the data set much more consistentin its use of the word "opacity".  But where appropriate, I also notethat this is equivalent to optical depth.>  DOCUMENT>>	This issue of descattering seems to be an important one.

The text I provided was as much as I could get fromthem.>	Likewise, the limit-cycle motion effects mentioned in the>TUTOIRAL.TXT file seem important.

I have added more information about limit cycle motion andits significance in the following files:  DOCUMENT/SPROFILE/SPROFILE.*  CALIB/CALINFO.TXT  EASYDATA/DATAINFO.TXT>  EASYDATA>>	The .LBL files all say that MEAN_SIGNAL field in the .TAB files is>formatted F7.3.

That should be easier formost users to view. The labels are now combined-detached labels thatdescribe both the VICAR and TIFF formats of the files.>  VECTORS>>	Could not characters 7 and/or 8 be used to identify those VECTOR>files that were generated under the assumption that the ring system is>extended and equatorial?  I think this would be useful for the user of>these data.I assume you are talking about the Uranian ring occultations, becausethese are the only ones where the ring plane varies due toinclinations. The standard we have used here and elsewhere in the dataset is to use the last two characters to identify a particular ringoccultation and direction. For the files generated under theassumption that the rings are equatorial, we leave off these last tocharacters. So UU1VC1DE.TAB describes the Delta ring egress, whereasUU1VC1.TAB describes the whole ring system under the assumption thatit is equatorial. This convention is also consistent with what we dofor the other planets, where most file names are only six characterslong.I would prefer to retain this consistency in our file naming. I havemade sure that the file VECTORS/DATAINFO.TXT makes this distinctionclear.>	Mention is made of "small, systematic errors of order 0.01>degrees" introduced by the rotation algorithm of routine J2000_VR.FOR.  >It is not clear to me whether or not these errors are limited to this>routine or whether or not such errors are manifest in the files generated>by the routines J2000_VC.FOR and J2000_VE.FOR.
