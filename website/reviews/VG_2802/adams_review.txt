Remember me???I'm way, way tardy in getting these comments to you.I won't offer you any excuses, even though I have afew.  Volume looks pretty good.  Only a few things,as are detailed on the attached list.  VG_2803validation in process, and shouldn't take more thana few days, assuming it is pretty similar to thisone.-StevenVG_2802 validation comments from PDS/CNAAREADME.TXT1.	AAREADME.TXT	A.	Line 94, HTML link is invalid.  Change to:		http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/sr/index.html		or the more general:		http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/	B.	line 150, HTML link is invalid.  Change to:		http://pds-naif.jpl.nasa.gov/	C.	ASCII tree of dir structure looks very nice.2.	VOLDESC.CAT	A.	Change: FACILITY_NAME = "SPACE SCIENCE DIVISION"	            To: FACILITY_NAME = "SPACE SCIENCE LABORATORY"		This was noted on the orig validation.  SSD is not listed		as a standard value while SSL is listed.3.	\TRAJECT\*.*	A.	Capitalize filenames and filename extensions in this		directory.  All other directories and sub-directories		okay.4.	\CATALOG\DATASET.CAT	A.	The catalog files on this volume ingested the other week.		Just as an advisory . . . CURATING_NODE_ID is now a required 		keyword for a DATASET.CAT file.				In this case, we used CURATING_NODE_ID = RINGS	B.	DATA_SET_INFORMATION object missing required element,		ABSTRACT_DESC.	C.	Existing standard value for ARCHIVE_STATUS is 		IN PEER REVIEW, not IN_PEER_REVIEW, (no underscores).5.	\CATALOG\CATINFO.TXT	A.	line 33 - change "INSTHOST.CAT" to "VG1HOST.CAT" and		"VG2HOST.CAT".  There is no "INSTHOST.CAT" on the volume		or in this directory.6.	\CATALOG\SOFTWARE.CAT	A.	There is a "problem" with the PROTOCOL_TYPE element in 		several of the SOFTWARE_ONLINE objects in this file.  The		PROTOCOL_TYPE element has a STD_VAL_TYPE = STATIC, which		means that new standard values must be approved by CN		before they can be used.  So far, there are only two		standard values for this keyword, those being URL and FTP.		You want to use three new ones.  These are; "COMPRESSED" for		OALV13.TAR.Z, "SOURCE" for lablib3.c, and "COMPRESSED TAR"		for LABLIB3.TAR.Z.		You can make a good case for using two of the three you		want to use.  But, "COMPRESSED" and "COMPRESSED TAR" is		somewhat redundant.  Both refer to tar files.  Pick one or		the other to use, not both.7.	\SOFTWARE\OAL\*	A.	Change filename \SOFTWARE\OAL\AAREADME.TXT to		\SOFTWARE\OAL\xxxxINFO.TXT (where xxxx is the appropriate 		name, (perhaps OALINFO.TXT?)).	B.	Change filename \SOFTWARE\OAL\EXAMPLES\README.TXT to		\SOFTWARE\OAL\EXAMPLES\xxxxINFO.TXT (where xxxx is the		appropriate name, (perhaps EXAMINFO.TXT?)).	C.	\SOFTWARE\OAL\IDL\README.TXT - as above.	D.	\SOFTWARE\PROFILE\AAREADME.TXT - as above.7.	There are no xxxxINFO.TXT files in the following non-data	directories.	\SOFTWARE\OAL\FORTRAN	\SOFTWARE\OAL\SOURCE	\SOFTWARE\PROFILE\EXAMPLES	\SOFTWARE\PROFILE\OALSRC	\SOFTWARE\PROFILE\SOURCE	\SPICE\IEEE		- but covered by \SPICE\DATAINFO.TXT	\SPICE\PC		- but covered by \SPICE\DATAINFO.TXT	\SPICE\TRANSFER		- but covered by \SPICE\DATAINFO.TXT	\SPICE\VAXG		- but covered by \SPICE\DATAINFO.TXT7.	\CATALOG\REF.CAT	A.	BROADFOOT&SANDEL1977			Can you verify "Ssanacon"?  The ref is in the DD with this		word spelled this way.  Is it correct?10.	There are 72 label files with the string "of of", as in:	DESCRIPTION = "Radial distance of the occultation intercept point 	from the center of of the planet, in kilometers.	The second (or first) occurrence of the word "of" needs to be	deleted.  This was noted in the orig validation as occurring in 122	label files.  It appears that it has been fixed in some of them,	but not all.11.	\DOCUMENT\EDITDATA\DATA\IOTAHER3.LBL	A.	line 85, change: END_OBJECT = SERIES			     to: END_OBJECT = TABLE12.	\GEOMETRY\US1G02.LBL	A.	line 12, 37, 57, 82 and 167			change: SOURCE_PRODUCT_ID = 'N/A'			    to: SOURCE_PRODUCT_ID = "N/A"13.	\RAWDATA\UN1R01I.LBL	A.	COLUMN is a required sub-object for the TABLE object.  It		is missing from this file.		B.	Also the following files in the \RAWDATA\ directory have		this same "problem" as above (13.A.).		1.	UN1R01P.LBL		13.	US3R01ID.LBL		2.	UN1R01V.LBL             14.	US3R01P.LBL 		3.	US1R01I.LBL             15.	US3R01PD.LBL		4.	US1R01P.LBL             16.	US3R01V.LBL 		5.	US1R01V.LBL             17.	US3R01VD.LBL		6.	US2R01I.LBL             18.	UU1R01I.LBL 		7.	US2R01ID.LBL            19.	UU1R01P.LBL 		8.	US2R01P.LBL             20.	UU1R01V.LBL 		9.	US2R01PD.LBL            21.	UU2R01I.LBL 		10.	US2R01V.LBL             22.	UU2R01P.LBL 		11.	US2R01VD.LB             23.	UU2R01V.LBL 		12.	US3R01I.LBl14.	\SORCDATA\	A.	Same "problem" (13.A., missing COLUMN sub-object) in the 		following files in this directory.			1.	BETPER.LBL		5.	DELSCO.LBL		2.	DELSCOI.LBL		6.	DELSCOID.LBL		3.	IOTAHER.LBL		7.	IOTAHERD.LBL		4.	SIGSAG_N.LBL		8.	SIGSAG_U.LBL15.	\SORCDATA\DELSCO1.LBL	A.	There are two START_TIME and STOP_TIME keyword/values in		this file.  Only one allowed. (lines 19 and 23 are the two		START_TIME and lines 20 and 24 the two STOP_TIME).16.	\RAWDATA\*.LBL (21 of the 24 label files in this directory have 	this "problem"/)	A.	EARTH_RECEIVED_START_TIME = NULL		EARTH_RECEIVED_STOP_TIME = NULL		NULL is to be used when the value is temporarily unknown.		UNK is to be used when the value is not known and never 		will be known.  In these label files, which is the case?		If temporarily unknown, does that mean you will submit a		new volume when the value is known?17.	\SORCDATA\*.LBL	A.	Same "problem" as above (16.A.)18.	\INDEX\INDEX.LBL	A.	Multiple instances of UNIT = 'N\A'		While technically correct, this is antiquated usage.  		The "more proper" usage would be: UNIT = "N/A". (The		apostrophe (single quote) has been replaced by quotes		(double quotes).19.	Data files and images look fine.  Not all files viewed, only a	representative sample.  TBTOOL and NASAVIEW had no problems.<eof>
