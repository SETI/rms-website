Sorry that I've taken so much longer than Isaid I would.  Now that I look over the whole archive again, it strikes mehow little of it I was able to really peruse.  Therefore, I fear that mycomments on this data set will be of limited use.  In general, I feltthat, as usual, the archiving of this data was very well done and warrantsfew changes.  However, there were a couple (see the one about theMEAN_SIGNAL field in the .LBL files!) that I think should be addressed.	If you have any questions or would like me to re-visit portions ofthe archive to write a more extensive analysis, please let me know.  I'dbe more than happy to do it.  It's very important to me that I fulfill theobligation for which I signed up.								--- ShawnPS - At least I caught some typos!**************************************************************************	The Voyager UVS ring occultation data set is a rather extensiveone, seeing as how it contains occultation data from three planetaryencounters.  Furthermore, the differing characteristics of the three ringsystems also complicates the archiving of these data into one volume.  Thus, it is a testament to the cleverness of the architecture of the PDSarchiving system that these data can be archived into one consistent,sensible (albeit complex) volume.  The data contained within are welldocumented.  They appear at different stages from raw data to afully-polished, edited data set.  The documentation that appears with thedata look to be rather complete.  For example, the detail provided in thedocumentation of the derivation of the Saturn occultation calibrationprofile is very useful.  The determination of these background counts isclearly not a trivial matter and the description included in file/DOCUMENT/SPROFILE/SPROFILE.PDF yields insight into the preparation of thedata.	Generally speaking, the data are carefully presented in a fashionthat make them easy to examine once the background information to thevolume has been fully digested by the user (and there is a lot of this!).  More specifc comments follow.  They are generally organized by the archivedirectory to which the comments are pertinent.  They are preceded by somemore general comments and followed by typographical errors I catalogued asI read through the documentation files.  General comments	The naming conventions strike me as somewhat awkward.  Is itnecessary, for example, to begin each file in this archive with a 'U' forUVS?  Is this some PDS restriction?  Otherwise, this one extra charactercould be used to further specify the data files, seeing as how all of thedata on this archive are UVS data and every file begins with a 'U'.  In asimilar vein, I found the way in which the particular occultations arenamed to be a little awkward as well.  Seems that there should be a moredescriptive way to differentiate occultations by two different stars otherthan something such as 'U1' versus 'U2', but I admittedly cannot think ofone that also conforms to PDS restrictions.  This is perhaps a personalpreference, however, and I do not strongly advocate any changes.	I would naively think that all of the programs that were used tomanipulate the raw data should be located under the SOFTWARE directory.  I think they should be.  Could the program files located under theDOCUMENTS directory not be moved to the SOFTWARE directory?  It seems thatthere was some motivation to separate the supported software from theunsupported software, but I think that this distinction could bemaintained with a specific subdirectory titled something like UNSUPPORTEDwithin the SOFTWARE directory.	This is probably a minor point, but it was initially unclear to methat ring opacity is used interchangeably with optical depth.  Forexample, in the calibration description file CALIB/CALINFO.TXT, it isstated that  "With these parameters, it is possible to convert from UVS counts to  optical depth tau by inverting this equation:      counts = STELLAR_SIGNAL * exp(-tau/MU) + BACKGROUND_SIGNAL  Here MU is the cosine of the incidence angle, which can be found in  the label of the corresponding geometry file."All of the data file labels refer to MEDIAN_NORMAL_OPACITY.  This wouldprobably not confuse anyone more familiar with ring occultation data, butit may be useful for a beginner to know.  An additional statement afterthe quote above to the effect of tau represents optical depth or ringopacity would have cleared this up for me.  Or, some mention of this inthe .LBL files.  (I see some mention in the DOCUMENT/TUTORIAL.TXT beneatha discussion of the calibration files now, but an extra mention or twocouldn't hurt, given the large number of files in this volume.)  DOCUMENT	This issue of descattering seems to be an important one.  Cananything be said about the extent to which this would affect the UVSspectra (i.e. the data that have not been co-added)?	Likewise, the limit-cycle motion effects mentioned in theTUTOIRAL.TXT file seem important.  I could not find mention of it anywherebut in this file.  Should this information not be repeated?  A quickreference in the information files in the EDITDATA or NOISDATAdirectories, for instance, might be appropriate.  EASYDATA	The .LBL files all say that MEAN_SIGNAL field in the .TAB files isformatted F7.3.  However, they all appear to formatted F8.3!!!  All of theother fields are formatted in a fashion consistent with what appears inthe .LBL files.  IMAGES	I've always found that dealing with images in VICAR format can bedifficult.  I have an IDL routine (it originated with Joel Plutchak atBrown University) that reads VICAR images into IDL format.  Otherwise, Iwould be routinely frustrated by them.  Would it not be possible toinclude the support images in some other format or include some softwaresuch as the routine that I described above?  Getting the VICAR softwarecan be very difficult and, I think, might be nearly impossible for foreignusers of this data set.  I suspect that reading images in VICAR formatwill be increasingly difficult decades from now.  VECTORS	Could not characters 7 and/or 8 be used to identify those VECTORfiles that were generated under the assumption that the ring system isextended and equatorial?  I think this would be useful for the user ofthese data.	Mention is made of "small, systematic errors of order 0.01degrees" introduced by the rotation algorithm of routine J2000_VR.FOR.  It is not clear to me whether or not these errors are limited to thisroutine or whether or not such errors are manifest in the files generatedby the routines J2000_VC.FOR and J2000_VE.FOR.  Can this be made clear?TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS:DOCUMENT/TUTORIAL.TXT -    "The instrument intrinsically recorded integers counts, where a single    photon generated on average 2.5 counts.
