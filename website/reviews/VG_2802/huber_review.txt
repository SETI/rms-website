Anyway, the volumes look pretty good forthe most part. Appended are my comments, some of which fairlysignificant.Lyle HuberPDS Atmospheres NodeVG_2802 Review==============- Does not seem to be ISO_9660 compliant. I had some trouble opening files  directly from the CD. It worked when I copied the files onto hard disk   though.- VECTORS/B1950/US2VE1LB.L and VECTORS/J2000/US2VE1LB.L should be  US2VE1.LBL. These files are also missing CR characters. These files also  have the incorrect keyword NODAL_RINGRESSION_RATE.- CATALOG/REF.CAT has non-ASCII characters in NICHOLSONETAL1990 entry.- RAWDATA/RAWDATAP.FMT has missing CR/LF at line 619.- *TIME label values should remove the trailing Z.- AAREADME.TXT, lines 429-430 are confusing.- In many labels you have the value 'N/A', I believe the preferred method  is "N/A".- You have some files with the extension .FIT. While this is not a reserved  extension, you might have some users who will think it's a FITS file.- In the DOCUMENT directory, you have several labels that have   ^ASCII_DOCUMENT that point to all of the Postscript figures in addition  to the ASCII text. I would discourage this usage. Use instead  ^ASCII_DOCUMENT to point to just the .ASC file and ^PS_DOCUMENT to  point to the Postscript figures.
