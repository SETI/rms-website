Overall, I'm quite impressed with the completeness of thiswork and the sheer number of files.	I spent some time browsing the tables in the EASYDATA directory,particularly those for the Voyager 2 Delta Sco egress occultation withwhich I'm the most familiar.  I was easily able to make plots of ringopacity vs. range to view the data. This is a nice, easy to use form of thedata that should be sufficient for most purposes. I also looked at the tablesin the EDITDATA directory, but don't have a really good way of viewingbinary tables at the moment. I tried to resurrect my IDL -> OAL software,but was never able to get it to work; it kept crashing every time I triedto load a table (with OaIDLReadObject). However, I was able to use tbtoolto to check out the table structure, to see how the GEOMETRY and CALIBtables are related to the spectrum index.	I also read through most of the documentation and catalog files.I found a number of minor things that should be addressed, so I'll includea list of these at the end of this message.					Terry---------------------------------------------------------------------------Documentation and catalog file comments:---------------aareadme.txt---------------	A number of places in this file refer only to Voyager 2, even thoughone Voyager 1 occultation data set is included. The obvious places are theNOTE near the top, the title, and the first line of the introduction. Also,the Voyager 1 SPICE files are not listed in the directory listing, thoughpresent in the SPICE directory itself. I suspect this file was written beforethe Voyager 1 Iota Her data was added.	The last line of the description of the SPICE/PC directory looks likesomething was left out or should have been something else entiirely  (reads"This workstations running Unix.").------------------catalog/person.cat------------------	Area code for BSANDEL, ABROADFOOT and TFORRESTER should be 520, not602. Phone numbers themselves are still correct, though.-------------------catalog/catinfo.txt-------------------	This file has a listing for 'insthost.cat' (for Voyager 2), whilecatalog files (vg1host.cat, vg2host.cat) are present for both spacecraft.-------------------catalog/dataset.cat-------------------	Under the 'Ancillary Data' heading, 'PPS' should be 'UVS'.-------------------calib/calinfo.txt-------------------	No mention is made of the Voyager 1 iota Her occultation, and nocalibration files are present for that data set.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
