<h1>Becker-Jarmak Solar Occultations Peer Review</h1>
Mitch Gordon, Mia Mace, and Matt Tiscareno<br>
June 1, 2022

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
This bundle contains derived time series resulting from occultations (ingress and egress) 
of the sun by the rings of Saturn observed by the Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph.
<p>
Details on the processing that results in the data 
files included in this bundle are given in Jarmak, <i>et al.</i>, 2022.
</p>

[Jarmak, <i>et al.</i>, 2022. <i>Solar occultation observations of Saturn's rings with Cassini UVIS</i>. Under review for publication in Icarus.]
</p>
<p>
<!-- There is a Becker, et al., 2021. paper referenced in the bundle.xml ? But couldn't find it on NASA ADS -->

<h3>Data Bundle</h3>
<p>
The file structure of the PDS4 bundle is shown below:

<p> The complete peer review bundle (cdap2018_becker_saturn_ring_particles_V9) is online <a href="/review-data/becker-solar-occs">here</a>. The derived solar occultation time series data products for scientific review reside in the data/ directory, and comprise 41 tables (suffix .tab) with accompanying XML PDS4 labels.</> 


<h3>Instructions for Reviewers</h3>

<!-- You may view the <a href="becker-solar-occs-review-instructions.html">detailed instructions here</a>, or download the <a href="becker-solar-occs-review-instructions.pdf"> PDF version here</a> (broken link for now). -->

<p>
Here are guidelines and some information to help you produce an effective review with a reasonable level of effort.
</p>

There are three general areas in which an archive is reviewed:

<ul>
<li>    Compliance with PDS4 Standards,
<li>    Scientific merit of data (are these the proper data to be archived?),
<li>    Usability of the data (appropriate formats; completeness of data set, including ancillary data; comprehensive documentation).
</ul>

<p>
If you are <b>not</b> one of the panel members with a direct affiliation with the PDS, you do <b>not</b> need to address the first bullet above, but rather focus on the data (including ancillary data) and documentation.
</p>
<p>
While it is not realistic for you to analyze every occultation profile, please check enough to convince yourself of the quality and consistency of the data and of any errors that you encounter.
</p>
<p>
Please also evaluate the documentation provided in individual table labels, and referenced journal articles. Much of the information contained in the referenced articles is not duplicated in the data sets.
</p>
<p>
Questions to ask are:
<ul>
<li> Does the documentation explain the data and how they were produced?
<li> Does the documentation explain how to use the data?
<li> Is the documentation (including referenced journal articles) sufficient to ensure the data will be intelligible to a scientist 10, 20, or 50 years in the future?
</ul>

The review panel members submit written reviews by email. If necessary, a video conference may be held to discuss the reviews, including strengths and weaknesses of the data set. Specific shortcomings and errors will be identified as "liens", which will need to be corrected. The review panel is responsible for making a recommendation on whether:
<ul>
<li> The volumes passed peer review and can be archived, once a set of panel-identified liens have been resolved.
<li> The material did not pass peer review, and must undergo an incremental (delta) review in certain specified areas.
<li> The material did not pass peer review, and must undergo another full peer review.
<li> The material did not pass peer review, and does not merit a second peer review.
</ul>

<p>
In addition to an overall recommendation, the chair (Mitch) will compile a list of "liens" &ndash; questions about or requests for change &ndash; in the archive design or products/bundle. The liens must be resolved before the associated data set can be archived.
