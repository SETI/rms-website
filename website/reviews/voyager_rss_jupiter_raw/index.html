<h1>Voyager RSS Jupiter Raw Data Peer Review</h1>
Mia Mace, Mitch Gordon, and Matt Tiscareno<br>
April, 2023

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
These two bundles contain raw RSS data from the Voyager 1 and 2 encounters with Jupiter, respectively.
<b>Reviewers should begin by reading the bundle_readme.txt files (top level of the bundles).</b>
</p>

<h3>Data Bundle</h3>
<p>
The directory structures of the two PDS4 bundles are illustrated in the following links for <a href="./tree_vg1.png" target="_blank">Voyager 1</a> and <a href="./tree_vg2.png" target="_blank"> Voyager 2<a/a>.</p>

<p> The complete peer review bundles (voyager_rss_jupiter_raw) are online <a href="/review-data/voyager_rss_jupiter_raw">here</a>.


<h3>Instructions for Reviewers</h3>

<!-- You may view the <a href="voyager_jupiter_rss_raw-review-instructions.html">detailed instructions here</a>, or download the <a href="voyager_jupiter_rss_raw-review-instructions.pdf"> PDF version here</a> (broken link for now). -->

<p>
Here are guidelines and some information to help you produce an effective review with a reasonable level of effort.
</p>

All reviewers must address two general areas:
<ul>
<li> Scientific merit of data (are these the proper data to be archived?),
<li> Usability of the data (appropriate formats; completeness of data set, including ancillary data; comprehensive documentation).
</ul>

Furthermore, if you are one of the panel members with a direct affiliation with the PDS, please also address a third general area:
<ul>
<li> Compliance with PDS4 Standards.
</ul>
If you are <b>not</b> one of the panel members with a direct affiliation with the PDS, then you do <b>not</b> need to address compliance with PDS4 standards. Rather, you should focus on the data (including ancillary data) and documentation.
<p>
While it is not realistic for you to analyze every data file, please check enough to convince yourself of the quality and consistency of the data and of any errors that you encounter.
</p>
<p>
Please also evaluate the documentation provided in individual table labels, and referenced journal articles. Much of the information contained in the referenced articles is not duplicated in the data sets.
</p>
<p>
Questions for reviewers to address are:
<ul>
<li> Documentation:
<ul>
<li> Does the documentation explain the data and how they were produced?
<li> Does the documentation explain how to use the data?
<li> Is the documentation (including referenced journal articles) sufficient to ensure the data will be intelligible to a scientist 10, 20, or 50 years in the future?
</ul>
<li> Data:
<ul>
<li> Are you able to manipulate and plot the data, interpret columns into tables, and understand the context and relationships of the data products?
<li> Are there any concerns about the creation/generation, calibration (if appropriate), or general usability of the data? 
<li> Is the archive design suitable (is the directory tree structured in a reasonable way)?
</ul>
</ul>
The review panel submits written reviews by email and then, if the RMS Node thinks it is necessary, participates in a teleconference (date TBD) to discuss the reviews, including strengths and weaknesses of the data set. Specific shortcomings and errors will be identified as "liens" &ndash; questions about or requests for change &ndash;  which will need to be corrected. The review panel is responsible for making a recommendation on whether:
<ul>
<li> The volumes passed peer review and can be archived, once a set of panel identified liens have been resolved.
<li> The material did not pass peer review, and must undergo an incremental (delta) review in certain specified areas.
<li> The material did not pass peer review, and must undergo another full peer review.
<li> The material did not pass peer review, and does not merit a second peer review.
</ul>

<p>
In addition to an overall recommendation, the RMS Node will compile a list of liens in the archive design or sample products/bundle. The liens must be resolved before the associated data set can be archived.
</p>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>

<p>
Due to a bug with the Validate tool, an erroneous entry in voyager2_rss_jupiter_raw_v1.0/data/collection_data.csv slipped through.<br/>

<br/>The entry:<br/>
<code>P,urn:nasa:pds:voyager2_rss_jupiter_raw:data:vg2j_14mr_1979191t131728::1.0</code>,<br/>
should instead state:<br/>
<code>P,urn:nasa:pds:voyager2_rss_jupiter_raw:data:vg2j_14mr_1979191t131727::1.0</code>.<br/>
<br/>Once reviewer reports have been received, this issue will be fixed alongside any other necessary modifications.
