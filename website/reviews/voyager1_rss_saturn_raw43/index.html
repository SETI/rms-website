<h1>Raw Radio Science Data from the Voyager 1 Ingress Radio Occultation at Saturn, collected at Canberra Observatory</h1>
Review facilitated by the Ring-Moon Systems Node of NASA PDS: Mia Mace, Matt Tiscareno<br>
May, 2025
</br>
<br>The data provider is Richard A. Simpson.</br>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
This bundle contains open-loop radio receiver data collected at the
Canberra (Australia) 64-m antenna of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSS-43)
during the Voyager 1 ingress radio occultation at Saturn on day
1980-318. The data include samples from receiver outputs at S-band
(13 cm wavelength) and X-band (3.6 cm) in right-circular polarization.
Also included are test measurements collected within a few hours of the
Saturn observations.  The data supported investigations of Saturn's
neutral atmosphere and ionosphere.
</br>

13 original data tapes -- known as Original Data Records (ODRs) --
were delivered to the Voyager Radio Science Team in a format that
(today) is unknown.  This format has similarities to the formats used
for the Voyager 1 and 2 encounters at Jupiter the previous year and
the Voyager 1 egress occultation at Saturn captured at DSS-63 just a
few hours later.  Although there are differences with these similar
formats, the time and sample data appear to be understood correctly
and the data may be suitable for new science analysis.
</br>
</br>

Each original tape forms the basis for a PDS4 product in the bundle.
The binary file is the first part of the product.  The binary data
have been converted to ASCII for easier reading.  There is one ASCII
table with record header data (to the extent that can be understood
from the limited documentation) and two ASCII files with the receiver
samples -- one with S-band samples and the other with X-band samples.
These are the second, third, and fourth parts of each PDS4 product.
Each product also includes a detached PDS4 label file written in XML
and a small ASCII file with terse titles for the fields in the header
table.
</br>
</br>

For example, the neutral atmospheric occultation began during binary
tape VA625.  The components of its corresponding product in this
archive are:</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;          vg1s_43mr_1980318t030501.xml (PDS4 label) </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;          va625a.odr                   (original binary file) </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;          vg1s_43mr_1980318t030501.tab (ASCII record headers) </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;          vg1s_43mr_1980318t030501.txt (ASCII header titles) </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;          vg1s_43sr_1980318t030501.tab (S-band receiver samples) </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;         vg1s_43xr_1980318t030501.tab (X-band receiver samples) </br>
</br>
</br>

In one case, a record could not be read from the ODR tape that was
delivered to the Voyager Radio Science Team.  A replacement record has
been substituted as part of the archiving task.  Field 6 in the binary
replacement record (Field 3 in the ASCII header record) has been set to
'2', and the corresponding receiver output samples have been set to
'127'.
</br>
</br>

In the files of ASCII samples, all sample values have been reduced by
127 so that the samples are distributed approximately uniformly around
zero.
</br>
</br>

Each ODR has been processed to give a pair of 'browse' summary plots,
each with a histogram of data sample values, a plot of average sample
power versus time, and a plot of time-averaged power spectra.  The
pair of browse summary plots has been combined with a PDS4 label to
create a single PDS4 data product.  There are 13 browse products --
one for each ODR product.
</br>
</br>

Also included in the bundle are reconstructions of the spacecraft
trajectory and spacecraft high-gain antenna pointing, which was
offset during the Saturn atmospheric occultation to compensate for
refraction.  Estimated frequencies of the spacecraft ultrastable
oscillator (USO) are also included.
</br>
</br>

The document collection includes a description of the Voyager mission,
a Software Interface Specification (SIS) for the archive bundle, and
a description of the high-gain antenna pointing reconstruction
procedure.  Documentation of the binary formats in the ODR (to the
extent that can be inferred from other documentation and from
examination of the binary files themselves) is included in the SIS.
</br>

<h3>Instructions for Reviewers</h3>
<p>
Here are guidelines and some information to help you produce an effective review with a reasonable level of effort.
</p>

All reviewers must address two general areas:
<ul>
<li> Scientific merit of data (are these the proper data to be archived?),
<li> Usability of the data (appropriate formats; completeness of data set, including ancillary data; comprehensive documentation).
</ul>

Furthermore, if you are one of the panel members with a direct affiliation with the PDS, please also address a third general area:
<ul>
<li> Compliance with PDS4 Standards.
</ul>
If you are <b>not</b> one of the panel members with a direct affiliation with the PDS, then you do <b>not</b> need to address compliance with PDS4 standards. Rather, you should focus on the data (including ancillary data) and documentation.
<p>
While it is not realistic for you to analyze every data file, please check enough to convince yourself of the quality and consistency of the data and of any errors that you encounter.
</p>
<p>
Please also evaluate the documentation provided in individual table labels, and referenced journal articles. Much of the information contained in the referenced articles is not duplicated in the data sets.
</p>
<p>
Questions for reviewers to address are:
<ul>
<li> Documentation:
<ul>
<li> Does the documentation explain the data and how they were produced?
<li> Does the documentation explain how to use the data?
<li> Is the documentation (including referenced journal articles) sufficient to ensure the data will be intelligible to a scientist 10, 20, or 50 years in the future?
</ul>
<li> Data:
<ul>
<li> Are you able to manipulate and plot the data, interpret columns into tables, and understand the context and relationships of the data products?
<li> Are there any concerns about the creation/generation, calibration (if appropriate), or general usability of the data? 
<li> Is the archive design suitable (is the directory tree structured in a reasonable way)?
</ul>
</ul>
The review panel submits written reviews by email and then, if the RMS Node thinks it is necessary, participates in a teleconference (date TBD) to discuss the reviews, including strengths and weaknesses of the data set. Specific shortcomings and errors will be identified as "liens" &ndash; questions about or requests for change &ndash;  which will need to be corrected. The review panel is responsible for making a recommendation on whether:
<ul>
<li> The bundle/s passed peer review and can be archived, once a set of panel identified liens have been resolved.
<li> The material did not pass peer review, and must undergo an incremental (delta) review in certain specified areas.
<li> The material did not pass peer review, and must undergo another full peer review.
<li> The material did not pass peer review, and does not merit a second peer review.
</ul>

<p>
In addition to an overall recommendation, the RMS Node will compile a list of liens in the archive design or sample products/bundle. The liens must be resolved before the associated data set can be archived.
</p>

</code>
These refer to Voyager 1 being described as 'Equipment' rather than 'Spacecraft'. This is because Voyager 1 is the 'target' of spacecraft engineering 'observations'. That is, the onboard engineering system is monitoring the status of the spacecraft. So, even though Voyager 1 is participating in observations of Saturn, the engineering system doesn't know that; its target is the spacecraft itself. 
RMS is submitting an SCR to discuss dual use context products for discussion within DDWG and CCB (in-prep). 
</li>
</ul>

These known issues will be resolved during lien resolution, along with any other issues raised by the reviewers and deemed reasonable/necessary.
