Subject: PDS data

Mark - I have looked over the PDS distribution of RPX images and the
comments of the other reviewers. I have just a few things to add:

1) as I understand it, each of the four images in a WFPC2 exposure has
its own header information, so that Phil's question about different
filters for the four chips is handled header by header, along with the
plate scale for that chip, right?

2) I agree with Amanda that some of the keywords in the headers from
STSCI are not just a little off, but can be VERY far off. THere needs to
be a way to flag this. ORIENTAT is one of these.

3) I'd like to compare the I/F conversion factors in the files to what I
computed by integrating over the solar spectrum and using Pat's information
about the filters. I am having trouble reading those headers at the
moment but will check them when I can read them. 

4) I like the idea of having a data directory at the root level. 

5) I have not read through the documentation to the level of trying to
find typographical errors, but overall it seems extensive and quite
thoroughly done.


More comments to follow, but wanted to get in on the conversation.
Dick
