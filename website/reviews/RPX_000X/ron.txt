Peer review comments

These are my initial comments on RPX_0001.  If you have any questions,
and I expect that you will, please call and we can work thru any issues.

(1)  ...\CALMASK\*.LBL

     (a)  The COMPRESSED_FILE object is required to have a FILE_RECORDS
          keyword.  I believe we talked about this in one of our
          meetings ???


(2)  CATALOG/SOFTWARE.LBL

     (a)  The template is missing END_OBJECT = SOFTWARE_INFORMATION
          See enclosure


(3)  CATALOG/REF.CAT

     (a)  The following REFKEYID is present in the INSTHOST.CAT
          but not in the REF.CAT.  Please add to REF.CAT:

          VOELS1995

     (b)  See the enclosure for the updated file.
          I have made minor corrections once again.

          It is not a good idea to enclose ref titles in single or
          double quotes because some titles include single quotes
          within the description.  The best way is to not quote these
          expressions:

		OBJECT                          = REFERENCE
  		REFERENCE_KEY_ID              = "MACROBERT1995A"
  		REFERENCE_DESC                = "MacRobert, A.M., Ed., Saturn's
			rings turn edge on, Sky and Telescope 89, 68-71, May 1995."
		END_OBJECT                      = REFERENCE


(4)  INDEX/INDEX.LBL
           CUMINDEX.LBL

     (a)  You must either rename the FILE_NAME column to
FILE_SPECIFICATION_NAME.
          OR you must separate the directory information from the file name
          and add a column for PATH_NAME.


(5)  INDEX/OBSCMIDX.LBL
           OBSINDEX.LBL

     (a)  Both of these files contain illegal characters which in
          this case are TABs.


(6)  CALIB/F130LP.TAB

     (a)  This file is only terminated with <LF>.  Once the file is
          terminated with <CR><LF>, and ROW_BYTES = 23 is set, then
          the file displays correctly.  But, there is a problem with
          NASAVIEW displaying this file for some reason.  It displays
          correctly using TBTOOL.


(7)  Keyword / Value search

     The following invalid keyword-values were found.

     (1)   DATA_SET_ID       HST-S-WFPC2-4-V1.0

		----------------------------------------
		Find 'HST-S-WFPC2-4-V1.0' in 'F:\INDEX\OBSCMIDX.LBL' :
		F:\INDEX\OBSCMIDX.LBL(7): DATA_SET_ID = "HST-S-WFPC2-4-V1.0"
		Found 'HST-S-WFPC2-4-V1.0' 1 time(s).
		----------------------------------------
		Find 'HST-S-WFPC2-4-V1.0' in 'F:\INDEX\OBSINDEX.LBL' :
		F:\INDEX\OBSINDEX.LBL(7): DATA_SET_ID = "HST-S-WFPC2-4-V1.0"
		Found 'HST-S-WFPC2-4-V1.0' 1 time(s).
		Search complete, found 'HST-S-WFPC2-4-V1.0' 2 time(s).


(8)  CATALOG/DATASET.CAT

     (a)  Under CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE you include [BIRETTAETAL1993]
          as a reference.  It might be more useful to summarize the
          paper, or include the paper in the documents directory.


(9)  DATA directories

     (a)  You might consider including a DATA directory at the root
          and making the data directories subdirectories of this one.
          It definitely makes the CD cleaner and it is very obvious
          where to find the data.


(10)  DATA/CALIMAGE/*.LBL
          /CALMASK/*.LBL
          /ENGDATA/*.LBL
          /ENGMASK/*.LBL
          /HEADER/*.LBL
          /RAWIMAGE/*.LBL
          /RAWMASK/*.LBL

      (a)  Within these label files, byte offsets are lowercase.
           The standards are unclear on this point.  But, CN has
           decided that the <bytes> units should be either uppercase
           or lowercase.  However, NasaView currently crashes when
           encountering lowercase units.  So, please convert the
           <bytes>  --->>> <BYTES>.  We will fix NasaView later.


(11)  DATA/BROWSE/*.GIF					 - able to view in Internet Explorer
          /CALIMAGE/*.IMG				 - able to view in NasaView
          /CALMASK/*.ZIP				 - able to explode and view
          /ENGDATA/*.ZIP				 - able to explode and view
          /ENGMASK/*.ZIP				 - able to explode and view
          /HEADER/*.ZIP					 - able to explode and view
          /RAWIMAGE/*.ZIP				 - able to explode and view
          /RAWMASK/*.ZIP				 - able to explode and view

      (a) Unzip - when I unzip the files in the RAWMASK directory
          the PKUNZIP program displayes the file names in lowercase.
          The NT operating system displays the unzipped files in
          uppercase.  I have not tested this on UNIX, but I am
          concerned that the files may be created with lowercase
          names ???

      (b) All of the label files require extensive editing in order
          to get NasaView to process the label/data.  None of these
          problems are due to label errors.  The new compressed
          objects are of course a problem that needs to be fixed
          within NasaView.  Other problems include:

          - if the NOTE keyword-value exceeds 60 characters, NasaView
            will crash.
          - some of the other extraneous keywords (either placement
            of or inclusion of) crashes NasaView.

          I think we should include a note in the ERRATA.TXT file
          that the current version of NasaView (2.5.2) cannot
          display the data.

  Software Overview
  =================
    From the Info-ZIP web site,
        http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/UnZip.html
    in September 1998:

    UnZip is an extraction utility for archives compressed in .zip
    format (also called 'zipfiles').  Although highly compatible
    both with PKWARE's PKZIP and PKUNZIP utilities for MS-DOS and
    with Info-ZIP's own Zip program, our primary objectives have
    been portability and non-MSDOS functionality.

    UnZip will list, test, or extract files from a .zip archive,
    commonly found on MS-DOS systems.  The default behavior (with
    no options) is to extract into the current directory (and
    subdirectories below it) all files from the specified zipfile.
    A companion program, Zip, creates .zip archives; both programs
    are compatible with archives created by PKZIP and PKUNZIP for
    MS-DOS, but in many cases the program options or default
    behaviors differ.  (For example, UnZip recreates the stored
    directory structure by default; PKUNZIP unpacks all files in
    the current directory by default.)
