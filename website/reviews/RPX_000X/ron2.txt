These are my initial comments on RPX_0002.  If you have any questions, 
and I expect that you will, please call and we can work thru any issues.

(1)  ...\CALIB\*.LBL

     (a)  PRODUCT_TYPE: CHARACTER value too long. 
                        (Must be less than 12 characters in length)


(2)  ...\BROWSE\*.LBL

     (a)  PUBLICATION_DATE: Inconsistent data type. 
                            (Value should be of type DATE): 1998-12-31
                            

(3)  .../CALMASK/*.LBL

     (a)  ENCODING_TYPE = ZIP 
     
          I have proposed that the new standard value be added.
          

(4)  .../CALIMAGE/*.LBL

     (a)  Change:  SPACECRAFT_NAME = HUBBLE_SPACE_TELESCOPE
              To:  SPACECRAFT_NAME = "HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE"
          Change:  INSTRUMENT_NAME = WIDE_FIELD_PLANETARY_CAMERA_2
              To:  INSTRUMENT_NAME = "WIDE FIELD PLANETARY CAMERA 2"
              
          Keywords of class NAME should not have embedded underscores.
          But rather should contain blanks.
              
     (b)  In the INST.CAT file, you have the following:
     
         INSTRUMENT_NAME             = "HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE"
         INSTRUMENT_TYPE             = "WIDE FIELD PLANETARY CAMERA 2"
         
         But, in the data file you specify the values differently or 
         have used the wrong keyword ???
         

(5)  .../HEADER/*.LBL

     (a)  The OBJECT and END_OBJECT values do not match:
     
     OBJECT                          = HEADER_TABLE
       NAME                          = HEADER_PACKET
       INTERCHANGE_FORMAT            = BINARY

       OBJECT                        = COLUMN
         NAME                        = PACKET_VALUES
         DATA_TYPE                   = MSB_INTEGER
         START_BYTE                  = 1
         BYTES                       = 2
       END_OBJECT                    = COLUMN
     END_OBJECT                      = TABLE
    
          
(6)  DOCUMENT/HSTHB.LBL

     (a)  Change:  OBJECT = POSTSCRIPT_DOCUMENT
              To:  OBJECT = PS_DOCUMENT
              
          Change:  END_OBJECT = POSTSCRIPT_DOCUMENT
              To:  END_OBJECT = PS_DOCUMENT

     (b)  Change:  DOCUMENT_FORMAT = PDF
              To:  DOCUMENT_FORMAT = ADOBE PDF
              
     These are the changes that were made to the new Chapt 9 in the
     Standards Reference.
              
     
(7)  VOLDESC.CAT

     (a)  FACILILTY_NAME = "RINGS NODE"  is not the value that I
          would have chosen.  Please look at the other values in
          our dictionary before using this choice.
          
          For example:  LABORATORY FOR ...
          
     (b)  Change: NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER          
              To: NASA/AMES RESEARCH CENTER
              
          This is already a standard value in our dictionary.
          
              
(8)  CALIB/F675W.LBL

     (a)  INSTITUTION_NAME = "LOWELL OBSERVATORY"
     
          Is there a university associated with the observatory.
          I'm not sure that an observatory qualifies as an institution ????
          

(9)  CALIB/F130LP.TAB

     (a)  Not all of the lines in the file are properly terminated.
