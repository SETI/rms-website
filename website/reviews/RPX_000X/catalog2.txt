CATALOG/MISSION.CAT
  The mission statement describes satellite mutual events, but for the most
    part they are not included in this cd distribution.  Some were observed
    during the HST campaigns, but as I recall, no observations were
    specifically targeted to them.

[MISSION.CAT is a general file, intended to describe this data set and 
others yet to be archived.]

- /CATALOG/DATASET.CAT
  - Data Set Overview, 1st para., taken taken --> taken
  - Data Set Overview, 2nd para., images original --> original
  - Data, 4th para., Zip 2.1 was used to create the zipfiles but UnZip 5.32
                     should be used to unzip them. That seems really strange
                     to have such different versions.

[LIEN: We will make all changes recommended.  We will check to confirm
that the Zip and Unzip version numbers are correct.]

(2)  CATALOG/SOFTWARE.LBL

     (a)  The template is missing END_OBJECT = SOFTWARE_INFORMATION
          See enclosure

[LIEN: We will fix.]

(3)  CATALOG/REF.CAT

     (a)  The following REFKEYID is present in the INSTHOST.CAT
          but not in the REF.CAT.  Please add to REF.CAT:

          VOELS1995

[LIEN: This reference is a web page.  We will get if from Lyle and add
it to our DOCUMENT directory.  Then we will add it to REF.CAT.] 

     (b)  See the enclosure for the updated file.
          I have made minor corrections once again.

          It is not a good idea to enclose ref titles in single or
          double quotes because some titles include single quotes
          within the description.  The best way is to not quote these
          expressions:

		OBJECT                          = REFERENCE
  		REFERENCE_KEY_ID              = "MACROBERT1995A"
  		REFERENCE_DESC                = "MacRobert, A.M., Ed., Saturn's
			rings turn edge on, Sky and Telescope 89, 68-71, May 1995."
		END_OBJECT                      = REFERENCE

[LIEN: We will change.]

(8)  CATALOG/DATASET.CAT

     (a)  Under CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE you include [BIRETTAETAL1993]
          as a reference.  It might be more useful to summarize the
          paper, or include the paper in the documents directory.

[LIEN: We will change the reference to BIRETTAETAL1996, which is better.
This is in the DOCUMENT directory as WFPC2*.*.  WFPC2.LBL will be
updated to indicate that the document corresponds to this reference.]
