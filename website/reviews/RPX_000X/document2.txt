  It would be nice if the DOCUMENT/TUTORIAL.TXT could be moved somewhat
    higher to make it easier to find.

[LIEN: We will add comments in AAREADME.TXT to highlight the existence
of this particular file.]

- /DOCUMENT/DOCINFO.TXT
  - FITSINFO.*, LaTex --> LaTeX
  - HSTHB*.*, Institute --> Science Institute

[LIEN: We will fix.]

- /DOCUMENT/FITSDEFS.TXT
  - FDMEANAN, anomly --> anomaly
  - PSTPTIME, yyyy.ddd --> yyyy:ddd
  - RTAMATCH, ???

[LIEN: We will fix "anomly".  The format of PSTPTIME has the period, not
the colon, so we will not make this change.  We agree that the
definition of RTAMATCH is cryptic.  However it only appears in header
files and appears unimportant for our purposes.  We will leave it
unchanged but will add a note to the file overall indicating that these
definitions come directly out of the FITS data files and that further
information can be found at the HST web site.]
