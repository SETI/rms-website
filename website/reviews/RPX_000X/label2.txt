LABEL/EXTTAB.FMT
  Is there a way to indicate somewhere that we have found that some header
    keyword values are not correct.  I think ORIENTAT is one of them.  It
    would be a shame to make others go through this exercise when we already
    know it.

[LIEN: We will warn users about ORIENTAT in TUTORIAL.TXT.]
