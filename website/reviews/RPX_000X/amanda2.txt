RTAMATCH:  FYI, I found this on the HST website.  Phil is correct, is deals
with Real Time Analysis.  It says:  "Real Time Analysis files are no longer
sent to PODPS.  This is an obsolete item.  This keyword should alway be
"NO RTA FI AVAILABL"".  So maybe add a comment to the /DOCUMENT/FITSDEFS.TXT
file that this is obsolete, and used to deal with real-time analysis files.

Another reference for the CATALOG/REF.CAT:
Bosh, A. S., A. S. Rivkin, J. W. Percival, M. Taylor, and G. W. van Citters 
1997. Saturn ring-plane crossing, May 1995: Pole precession and Ring thickness. 
Icarus 129, 555-561.

My FGS contact has disappeared, I have an email in to him, I'll get back
to you about PA_V3 when I hear back from Larry.
