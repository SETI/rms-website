General
  Why do data folder names end in XX?  Is it to pad out to some standard
    length?

  What is the justification for releasing just HST/WFPC2?  I can see that
    HST would be much simpler than various ground-based data sets because
    it is auto-archived.  But why the constraint to WFPC2?  There are some
    HRS and FOS data as well that are intimately tied to the RPX timing.

  What does "^" mean at the beginning of a header line?  Is it a new FITS
    thing?

Comments on the data set:

My comments are very positive in the sense that I have been
able without difficulty to understand the whole organisation
of the data set and look at the files and labels. It seems to
me that if I wanted now to use these data I could do it.

- Each disk had one file that was unreadable on my Solaris 2.6 and 2.7 
  machines:
    RPX_0001  DOCUMENT/FITS.TXT
    RPX_0002  AAREADME.TXT
    RPX_0003  AAREADME.TXT
    RPX_0004  AAREADME.TXT
    RPX_0005  AAREADME.TXT

- In all labels:
    SPACECRAFT_NAME and INSTRUMENT_NAME values should be delimited by 
    double quotes, not connected by underscores.

    The default unit for EXPOSURE_DURATION is milliseconds so these
    values should be appended with <SECONDS>.

- /AAREADME.TXT
  - e-mail address for John Caldwell is incorrect.

I have browsed thru 3 of the CD's and not found anything amiss so far.
The organization seems very logical & pretty easy to follow, and I like
having all the documentation files on each CD.  The arrangement of datasets
by ID number, while perhaps weird to most users, seems to make the most
sense. (Perhaps the list of the PI and dates for each of these IDs
which I found in the tutorial might be added to the aareadme file
so that a novice user would find it immediately?) On balance, I think
this is better than inventing completely ad hoc identifiers.

Mark-
	I think the documentation and layout of the RPX PDS discs
is excellent. I had some initial problems with permissions when
copying to disc, but they were local problems that were fixed.
Below are more specific comments. 

	I looked at the RPX PDS discs with two systems:

A. Sun Ultra running the current rev. of Solaris looking at GIF
and FITS images with XV, FITS images with the current rev.of IRAF,
pdf files with acrobat reader 4.0 and postscript files with ghostview
and a level 1 printer.

B. IBM Thinkpad 600 on the Windoze 98 side (I have not yet installed
IRAF on the Linux side) looking at pdf files with Acrobat 2.1 (or
trying to) and GIF images with MS Internet Explorer.

	Here are my comments on the contents of the discs in order of
use;
	
1. aareadme.txt (maybe aareadfirst.txt might be more explicit) This
is well laid out and the obvious entry point for new users of this
data. The discussions of file formats, file naming, and directory
structure looks complete. It is sufficiently well done that I did not
have any problem finding my way around (therefore it MUST be good!).

2. errata.txt, voldesc.cat - useful for volume-specific information.

3. document/tutorial.txt - good second level user information describing
data sets, goals from the proposal abstracts (and therefore what to expect)
and additional details defining file types, labels, and pointers to 
documents on filters, etc. Had no trouble reading files on the Sun, but
the Acrobat reader 2.1 on the Thinkpad could not read pdf files (I
suspect this is a problem with Acrobat, but will have to look into this
further to know.)

4. The primary text files in the subdirectories were all helpful in
describing the other files in their directories. The directories calib,
catalog, geometry, index, label and software were all useful. I have not
had time to test any of the SPICE data in geometry, but it looks pretty
complete.

File formats:

I looked
at the CD-ROMs using a Sparc Ultra-1 running Solaris. I was able to
display the GIF files from the browse directories directly with Sun's
image viewer (ie, I just double-clicked on the icons in the File
Manager window). However, SOLARIS did not recognise the .TXT files
as text (it tried to run them...) so I looked at them with the UNIX 
'more' command instead. I have not so far examined the pdf or ps files.
I did unzip one of the label files using my local version of 'unzip',
after copying the file to disk.

5) I have not read through the documentation to the level of trying to
find typographical errors, but overall it seems extensive and quite
thoroughly done.
