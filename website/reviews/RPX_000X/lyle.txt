RPX_000x Review
===============

- Each disk had one file that was unreadable on my Solaris 2.6 and 2.7 
  machines:
    RPX_0001  DOCUMENT/FITS.TXT
    RPX_0002  AAREADME.TXT
    RPX_0003  AAREADME.TXT
    RPX_0004  AAREADME.TXT
    RPX_0005  AAREADME.TXT

- In all labels:
    SPACECRAFT_NAME and INSTRUMENT_NAME values should be delimited by 
    double quotes, not connected by underscores.

    The default unit for EXPOSURE_DURATION is milliseconds so these
    values should be appended with <SECONDS>.

- /AAREADME.TXT
  - e-mail address for John Caldwell is incorrect.

- /CALIB/F130LP.TAB is not CR-LF delimited.

- /CATALOG/DATASET.CAT
  - Data Set Overview, 1st para., taken taken --> taken
  - Data Set Overview, 2nd para., images original --> original
  - Data, 4th para., Zip 2.1 was used to create the zipfiles but UnZip 5.32
                     should be used to unzip them. That seems really strange
                     to have such different versions.
