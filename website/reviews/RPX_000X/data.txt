  SC_TARGET_POSITION_VECTOR:  the TUTORIAL.TXT says that these are actually
    geocentric.  Is this information included anywhere else closer to the
    data files (people may not read or remember the tutorial).  The keyword
    is confusing given the definition of the value provided.  It would be
    better to either change the keyword to be accurate, or to include the
    spacecraft ephemeris.  The definitive ephemerides are easy to get and
    use (I have a tutorial if you need one).
  CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE:  is this from the header keywords?  If so, it
    may not be correct.  Why not just call it position angle?
  BODY_POLE_CLOCK_ANGLE:  does this include pole precession, and if so, what
    reference.  Either way, what is the reference for the pole position?

  Just a note:  I was unable to get these files to open with GraphicConverter
    unless I first unchecked "Detect only clear Formats" in Preferences:Open,
    otherwise it thought it was a different type of file because of the
    suffix.  GraphicConverter is used to seeing *.fits if it's a FITS file,
    I guess.  [Mac PBG3]

RPX_000n:1995nnXX/whatever/RAWIMAGE/*.ZIP
  I unable to unzip this with the program Unzip (I grabbed the compiled one
    from the website rather than compile one using the files on the CD).
    Error message:  "cannot find either 010A_D0F.ZIP or 010A_DOF.ZIP.zip"
    It worked if I used StuffIt Expander.

  Technically, A301 and A302 were Phil's, but we split an orbit so they
    assigned them to me.  It's not a hugely important thing, but if anyone
    cares we can move them over to Phil's directory.  Although they'll then
    be inconsistent between HST naming and this CD directory structure, so 
    it's probably better to leave them where they are.

The first one is in the display of the GIF files in the
subdirectories "browse". The images of PC1 have been rescaled
and rotated to show the whole image of Saturn when the image
has been taken on PC1 and WF4. This is a good idea but this
should be explained in the tutorial in the fourth paragraph
(4. HST/WFPC2 Images and Filters). If you have never seen the
images, it is difficult to realize why the PC1 images are so
small whereas the pixel size is twice smaller than the pixel
size of the WF.

These are my initial comments on RPX_0001.  If you have any questions,
and I expect that you will, please call and we can work thru any issues.

(1)  ...\CALMASK\*.LBL

     (a)  The COMPRESSED_FILE object is required to have a FILE_RECORDS
          keyword.  I believe we talked about this in one of our
          meetings ???

(9)  DATA directories

     (a)  You might consider including a DATA directory at the root
          and making the data directories subdirectories of this one.
          It definitely makes the CD cleaner and it is very obvious
          where to find the data.


(10)  DATA/CALIMAGE/*.LBL
          /CALMASK/*.LBL
          /ENGDATA/*.LBL
          /ENGMASK/*.LBL
          /HEADER/*.LBL
          /RAWIMAGE/*.LBL
          /RAWMASK/*.LBL

      (a)  Within these label files, byte offsets are lowercase.
           The standards are unclear on this point.  But, CN has
           decided that the <bytes> units should be either uppercase
           or lowercase.  However, NasaView currently crashes when
           encountering lowercase units.  So, please convert the
           <bytes>  --->>> <BYTES>.  We will fix NasaView later.


(11)  DATA/BROWSE/*.GIF					 - able to view in Internet Explorer
          /CALIMAGE/*.IMG				 - able to view in NasaView
          /CALMASK/*.ZIP				 - able to explode and view
          /ENGDATA/*.ZIP				 - able to explode and view
          /ENGMASK/*.ZIP				 - able to explode and view
          /HEADER/*.ZIP					 - able to explode and view
          /RAWIMAGE/*.ZIP				 - able to explode and view
          /RAWMASK/*.ZIP				 - able to explode and view

      (a) Unzip - when I unzip the files in the RAWMASK directory
          the PKUNZIP program displayes the file names in lowercase.
          The NT operating system displays the unzipped files in
          uppercase.  I have not tested this on UNIX, but I am
          concerned that the files may be created with lowercase
          names ???

      (b) All of the label files require extensive editing in order
          to get NasaView to process the label/data.  None of these
          problems are due to label errors.  The new compressed
          objects are of course a problem that needs to be fixed
          within NasaView.  Other problems include:

          - if the NOTE keyword-value exceeds 60 characters, NasaView
            will crash.
          - some of the other extraneous keywords (either placement
            of or inclusion of) crashes NasaView.

          I think we should include a note in the ERRATA.TXT file
          that the current version of NasaView (2.5.2) cannot
          display the data.

5. The data files. I had no problem looking at the browse gif files and
labels. Spot checks indicate that the labels looked consistent with the
images. The calibrated images could be looked at with XV (in its limited
way), but I had to use the IRAF task rfits to copy them to disc in IRAF
format. IRAF would not display the images directly from the CD. The
compressed raw files could be unzipped to disc from the destination
directory.

	So, except for the awkwardness of having to rfits images from
cd in IRAF, things seemed to work. I would be interested in what others
found.

I really like all the geometric & photometric parameters you have added
to the PDS labels. I will check some of the photometry numbers tomorrow
against my own notes. Ditto for a few geometry numbers, which Dick
generated for our data. These labels
are also easier to read than the original FITS headers, as they have
all the important info (filter, etc.) up front. 

I also like the mini-images in the browse directory, and the fact
that you have included a solar spectrum and filter profiles.

So far the **ONLY** thing I have found which might be slightly
misleading concerns the methane quad filters with which the bulk of
these data were taken. Strictly, this leads to a different wavelength
for each chip, as the 890 nm portion only covers one chip at a time.
Since sometimes part of Saturn is in an adjacent chip (eg., WF3), this
is seen thru a different methane filter. Is this worth including?
We could figure out from the HST WFPC2 handbook which filter is on
each chip for PC1 or WF3 observations. Right now, your headers
seem to allow for just 1 filter for the whole 4 frames in a file.
Also I presume the calibration data is for the 890 nm filter only;
Pat may not even have that for the other quad segments.

FITS images:

Since others used IRAF, I should report that I was able to read the
FITS image files in IDL 5.1 using the 'readfits' command, directly from
the disk and with no problems.  

I carefully compared several
specific images from our own Aug and Nov data sets against my own
copies of these images, just to see that everything was labelled
correctly. All checked out OK.  I even found some images I had forgotten
were taken, so the set seems to be very complete.

GIF images:

I think the fact that you have reassembled all 4 images from each
original HST files with their correct orientation and scale in the
GIF images is a good thing. I found a sketch of the WFPC2 layout in one
of the documentation files. Otherwise the 90 deg rotations of the 
individual PC or WF images could be very confusing.  Perhaps you
could note somewhere (in the volume description?) that the
orientation on the sky of the HST FOV switches 180 deg at opposition,
so the May and Aug images are oppositely oriented to the Nov images.
(This is implicit in the CLOCK_ANGLE values, of course.)

1) as I understand it, each of the four images in a WFPC2 exposure has
its own header information, so that Phil's question about different
filters for the four chips is handled header by header, along with the
plate scale for that chip, right?

2) I agree with Amanda that some of the keywords in the headers from
STSCI are not just a little off, but can be VERY far off. THere needs to
be a way to flag this. ORIENTAT is one of these.

3) I'd like to compare the I/F conversion factors in the files to what I
computed by integrating over the solar spectrum and using Pat's information
about the filters. I am having trouble reading those headers at the
moment but will check them when I can read them. 

4) I like the idea of having a data directory at the root level.
