My second remark is more important. I think an easy index to
the files is missing. There is an index for each disk and an
index for the whole set in the subdirectories "index", but
they are quite impossible to read. If you display them on the
screen of your computer you have to make an enormous window,
and even like this each image is described in several lines
on the screen. I would call this index the "formal" index and
I think it has to be there. But I am sure potential users would
find useful another index which gives only the most useful
information, so that it is much smaller and easier to read.
In the headers the main part of the information has already been
given many times, and after a while you don't even look at it,
but since it is there, it hides the particular information which
has to be given just for the image described. I have tried to
write down such an index with the information taken in the headers.
I think this index should be in the "browse" directories
for each of these directories and a general one somewhere
on the disks.

I did it for the cd 5 but in fact I realised it was missing when
I looked at the images of the cd3 which are the images of the
August ring plane crossing. Since I had reduced these data,
I had my own notes and images and I compared them to the gif files
of RPX_0003/199508XX/U2TFXXXX which are the images of the proposal
5836 by Nicholson. I was unable to find some of the files that you
(Mark Showalter) had sent to me. When I looked carefully, I found
that these images had been taken in the proposal 6216 by Trauger.
So I had to go to another directory and look at the labels. If I
had not known that these images were in fact taken at the same time
as the Nicholson images I am not sure I would have found them.

I wrote the "easy index" for the CD 5 that I did not know.
Here is an attempt of what I think would be useful:

I think that if you have such an index you can easily see which
are the dates and the filters. A problem is "where are the
images". With all the informations given in the header you
cannot find this information anywhere and you are obliged to
look at the images. In fact if you realize that there is some
kind of code you can derive this information. Here for instance
on some images is written "HST Target name: SATURN-WEST-ANSA".
That means that the image has been taken on PC1 only. On others
is written "HST Target name: SATURN-EAST-ANSA": the image is taken
also on WF4. But the label "SATURN-EAST-ANSA" is wrong since you
have both ansae. I think that since the kind of index I am
proposing is not a "legal" one you could change the legal
appelation "PC1-FIX" which gives only the information that the
image has been taken on the right side of the mosaick by the
appelations "PC1" or "PC1-WF4".

(4)  INDEX/INDEX.LBL
           CUMINDEX.LBL

     (a)  You must either rename the FILE_NAME column to
FILE_SPECIFICATION_NAME.
          OR you must separate the directory information from the file name
          and add a column for PATH_NAME.


(5)  INDEX/OBSCMIDX.LBL
           OBSINDEX.LBL

     (a)  Both of these files contain illegal characters which in
          this case are TABs.

(7)  Keyword / Value search

     The following invalid keyword-values were found.

     (1)   DATA_SET_ID       HST-S-WFPC2-4-V1.0
