Mark,

I followed your recommendation and here are my comments on
the disks. I am leaving tomorrow and I am not sure that I'll
be able to read my e-mail until end of August. I am going
to a small French village and until recently there was no
access to the internet!

Best regards

Claude

Comments on the data set:

My comments are very positive in the sense that I have been
able without difficulty to understand the whole organisation
of the data set and look at the files and labels. It seems to
me that if I wanted now to use these data I could do it.
There are only two points I'd like to comment.

The first one is in the display of the GIF files in the
subdirectories "browse". The images of PC1 have been rescaled
and rotated to show the whole image of Saturn when the image
has been taken on PC1 and WF4. This is a good idea but this
should be explained in the tutorial in the fourth paragraph
(4. HST/WFPC2 Images and Filters). If you have never seen the
images, it is difficult to realize why the PC1 images are so
small whereas the pixel size is twice smaller than the pixel
size of the WF.

My second remark is more important. I think an easy index to
the files is missing. There is an index for each disk and an
index for the whole set in the subdirectories "index", but
they are quite impossible to read. If you display them on the
screen of your computer you have to make an enormous window,
and even like this each image is described in several lines
on the screen. I would call this index the "formal" index and
I think it has to be there. But I am sure potential users would
find useful another index which gives only the most useful
information, so that it is much smaller and easier to read.
In the headers the main part of the information has already been
given many times, and after a while you don't even look at it,
but since it is there, it hides the particular information which
has to be given just for the image described. I have tried to
write down such an index with the information taken in the headers.
I think this index should be in the "browse" directories
for each of these directories and a general one somewhere
on the disks.

I did it for the cd 5 but in fact I realised it was missing when
I looked at the images of the cd3 which are the images of the
August ring plane crossing. Since I had reduced these data,
I had my own notes and images and I compared them to the gif files
of RPX_0003/199508XX/U2TFXXXX which are the images of the proposal
5836 by Nicholson. I was unable to find some of the files that you
(Mark Showalter) had sent to me. When I looked carefully, I found
that these images had been taken in the proposal 6216 by Trauger.
So I had to go to another directory and look at the labels. If I
had not known that these images were in fact taken at the same time
as the Nicholson images I am not sure I would have found them.

I wrote the "easy index" for the CD 5 that I did not know.
Here is an attempt of what I think would be useful:

I think that if you have such an index you can easily see which
are the dates and the filters. A problem is "where are the
images". With all the informations given in the header you
cannot find this information anywhere and you are obliged to
look at the images. In fact if you realize that there is some
kind of code you can derive this information. Here for instance
on some images is written "HST Target name: SATURN-WEST-ANSA".
That means that the image has been taken on PC1 only. On others
is written "HST Target name: SATURN-EAST-ANSA": the image is taken
also on WF4. But the label "SATURN-EAST-ANSA" is wrong since you
have both ansae. I think that since the kind of index I am
proposing is not a "legal" one you could change the legal
appelation "PC1-FIX" which gives only the information that the
image has been taken on the right side of the mosaick by the
appelations "PC1" or "PC1-WF4".

Otherwise I am very impressed by the amount of excellent work
made to help people to use this data set.
