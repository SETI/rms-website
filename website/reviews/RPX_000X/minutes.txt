General
  Why do data folder names end in XX?  Is it to pad out to some standard
    length?

[To indicate files are organized by month, and to match other PDS data
sets.  No change.] 

  What is the justification for releasing just HST/WFPC2?  I can see that
    HST would be much simpler than various ground-based data sets because
    it is auto-archived.  But why the constraint to WFPC2?  There are some
    HRS and FOS data as well that are intimately tied to the RPX timing.

[Other data are yet to be archived.]

  What does "^" mean at the beginning of a header line?  Is it a new FITS
    thing?

[PDS notation for a pointer to another file.]

C. Roddier

Comments on the data set:

My comments are very positive in the sense that I have been
able without difficulty to understand the whole organisation
of the data set and look at the files and labels. It seems to
me that if I wanted now to use these data I could do it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
L. Huber

- Each disk had one file that was unreadable on my Solaris 2.6 and 2.7 
  machines:
    RPX_0001  DOCUMENT/FITS.TXT
    RPX_0002  AAREADME.TXT
    RPX_0003  AAREADME.TXT
    RPX_0004  AAREADME.TXT
    RPX_0005  AAREADME.TXT

[Others did not have problems with these files.  We will send a final
sample disk to Lyle for further testing.]

- In all labels:
    SPACECRAFT_NAME and INSTRUMENT_NAME values should be delimited by 
    double quotes, not connected by underscores.

[LIEN: We will fix]

    The default unit for EXPOSURE_DURATION is milliseconds so these
    values should be appended with <SECONDS>.

[LIEN: We will fix]

- /AAREADME.TXT
  - e-mail address for John Caldwell is incorrect.

[LIEN: We will fix]

I have browsed thru 3 of the CD's and not found anything amiss so far.
The organization seems very logical & pretty easy to follow, and I like
having all the documentation files on each CD.  The arrangement of datasets
by ID number, while perhaps weird to most users, seems to make the most
sense. (Perhaps the list of the PI and dates for each of these IDs
which I found in the tutorial might be added to the aareadme file
so that a novice user would find it immediately?) On balance, I think
this is better than inventing completely ad hoc identifiers.

[LIEN: A list of PIs and dates will be added to AAREADME.TXT.  This will
be copied from DATASET.CAT.] 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
S. Larson

Mark-
	I think the documentation and layout of the RPX PDS discs
is excellent. I had some initial problems with permissions when
copying to disc, but they were local problems that were fixed.
Below are more specific comments. 

	I looked at the RPX PDS discs with two systems:

A. Sun Ultra running the current rev. of Solaris looking at GIF
and FITS images with XV, FITS images with the current rev.of IRAF,
pdf files with acrobat reader 4.0 and postscript files with ghostview
and a level 1 printer.

B. IBM Thinkpad 600 on the Windoze 98 side (I have not yet installed
IRAF on the Linux side) looking at pdf files with Acrobat 2.1 (or
trying to) and GIF images with MS Internet Explorer.

	Here are my comments on the contents of the discs in order of
use;
	
1. aareadme.txt (maybe aareadfirst.txt might be more explicit) This
is well laid out and the obvious entry point for new users of this
data. The discussions of file formats, file naming, and directory
structure looks complete. It is sufficiently well done that I did not
have any problem finding my way around (therefore it MUST be good!).

[AAREADME.TXT is a standard name required by the PDS.  No change.]

2. errata.txt, voldesc.cat - useful for volume-specific information.

3. document/tutorial.txt - good second level user information describing
data sets, goals from the proposal abstracts (and therefore what to expect)
and additional details defining file types, labels, and pointers to 
documents on filters, etc. Had no trouble reading files on the Sun, but
the Acrobat reader 2.1 on the Thinkpad could not read pdf files (I
suspect this is a problem with Acrobat, but will have to look into this
further to know.)

4. The primary text files in the subdirectories were all helpful in
describing the other files in their directories. The directories calib,
catalog, geometry, index, label and software were all useful. I have not
had time to test any of the SPICE data in geometry, but it looks pretty
complete.

[LIEN: We will take another look at the SPICE data directories to make
sure there are no problems.] 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
P. Nicholson

File formats:

I looked
at the CD-ROMs using a Sparc Ultra-1 running Solaris. I was able to
display the GIF files from the browse directories directly with Sun's
image viewer (ie, I just double-clicked on the icons in the File
Manager window). However, SOLARIS did not recognise the .TXT files
as text (it tried to run them...) so I looked at them with the UNIX 
'more' command instead. I have not so far examined the pdf or ps files.
I did unzip one of the label files using my local version of 'unzip',
after copying the file to disk.

[No change required.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
R. French

5) I have not read through the documentation to the level of trying to
find typographical errors, but overall it seems extensive and quite
thoroughly done.

[No change required.]

========================================================================
CALIB directory
========================================================================

L. Huber

- /CALIB/F130LP.TAB is not CR-LF delimited.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
R. Joyner

(6)  CALIB/F130LP.TAB

     (a)  This file is only terminated with <LF>.  Once the file is
          terminated with <CR><LF>, and ROW_BYTES = 23 is set, then
          the file displays correctly.  But, there is a problem with
          NASAVIEW displaying this file for some reason.  It displays
          correctly using TBTOOL.

[LIEN: We will fix.]

======================================================================== 
CATALOG directory
========================================================================
 
A. Bosh

CATALOG/MISSION.CAT
  The mission statement describes satellite mutual events, but for the most
    part they are not included in this cd distribution.  Some were observed
    during the HST campaigns, but as I recall, no observations were
    specifically targeted to them.

[MISSION.CAT is a general file, intended to describe this data set and 
others yet to be archived.]

R. Joyner

(2)  CATALOG/SOFTWARE.LBL

     (a)  The template is missing END_OBJECT = SOFTWARE_INFORMATION
          See enclosure

[LIEN: We will fix.]

(3)  CATALOG/REF.CAT

     (a)  The following REFKEYID is present in the INSTHOST.CAT
          but not in the REF.CAT.  Please add to REF.CAT:

          VOELS1995

[LIEN: This reference is a web page.  We will get if from Lyle and add
it to our DOCUMENT directory.  Then we will add it to REF.CAT.] 

     (b)  See the enclosure for the updated file.
          I have made minor corrections once again.

          It is not a good idea to enclose ref titles in single or
          double quotes because some titles include single quotes
          within the description.  The best way is to not quote these
          expressions:

		OBJECT                          = REFERENCE
  		REFERENCE_KEY_ID              = "MACROBERT1995A"
  		REFERENCE_DESC                = "MacRobert, A.M., Ed., Saturn's
			rings turn edge on, Sky and Telescope 89, 68-71, May 1995."
		END_OBJECT                      = REFERENCE

[LIEN: We will change.]

(8)  CATALOG/DATASET.CAT

     (a)  Under CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE you include [BIRETTAETAL1993]
          as a reference.  It might be more useful to summarize the
          paper, or include the paper in the documents directory.

[LIEN: We will change the reference to BIRETTAETAL1996, which is better.
This is in the DOCUMENT directory as WFPC2*.*.  WFPC2.LBL will be
updated to indicate that the document corresponds to this reference.]

RPX_000n:1995nnXX/whatever/CALIMAGE/*.LBL
  SC_TARGET_POSITION_VECTOR:  the TUTORIAL.TXT says that these are actually
    geocentric.  Is this information included anywhere else closer to the
    data files (people may not read or remember the tutorial).  The keyword
    is confusing given the definition of the value provided.  It would be
    better to either change the keyword to be accurate, or to include the
    spacecraft ephemeris.  The definitive ephemerides are easy to get and
    use (I have a tutorial if you need one).

[LIEN: We will add a comment in the label to indicate the offset of HST
from the center of Earth has not been included.] 

  CELESTIAL_NORTH_CLOCK_ANGLE:  is this from the header keywords?  If so, it
    may not be correct.  Why not just call it position angle?

[LIEN: It's based on PA_V3, which was always correct in the Nicholson
data. We will do some spot checks to make sure values look reasonable
for data from other PIs.  We will note that this is what we did in
TUTORIAL.TXT, and that ORIENTAT is unreliable.] 

  BODY_POLE_CLOCK_ANGLE:  does this include pole precession, and if so, what
    reference.  Either way, what is the reference for the pole position?

[LIEN: The information will be added to TUTORIAL.TXT.]

RPX_000n:1995nnXX/whatever/CALIMAGE/*.IMG
  Just a note:  I was unable to get these files to open with GraphicConverter
    unless I first unchecked "Detect only clear Formats" in Preferences:Open,
    otherwise it thought it was a different type of file because of the
    suffix.  GraphicConverter is used to seeing *.fits if it's a FITS file,
    I guess.  [Mac PBG3]

[No change]

RPX_000n:1995nnXX/whatever/RAWIMAGE/*.ZIP
  I unable to unzip this with the program Unzip (I grabbed the compiled one
    from the website rather than compile one using the files on the CD).
    Error message:  "cannot find either 010A_D0F.ZIP or 010A_DOF.ZIP.zip"
    It worked if I used StuffIt Expander.

[No change]

RPX_0005:199511XX/U2ZYXXXX/
  Technically, A301 and A302 were Phil's, but we split an orbit so they
    assigned them to me.  It's not a hugely important thing, but if anyone
    cares we can move them over to Phil's directory.  Although they'll then
    be inconsistent between HST naming and this CD directory structure, so 
    it's probably better to leave them where they are.

[LIEN: We will update labels to indicate correct PIs.  We will add a
note to TUTORIAL.TXT indicating that some images were traded between
PIs.  Phil will provide the list of images that were traded.] 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
C. Roddier

The first one is in the display of the GIF files in the
subdirectories "browse". The images of PC1 have been rescaled
and rotated to show the whole image of Saturn when the image
has been taken on PC1 and WF4. This is a good idea but this
should be explained in the tutorial in the fourth paragraph
(4. HST/WFPC2 Images and Filters). If you have never seen the
images, it is difficult to realize why the PC1 images are so
small whereas the pixel size is twice smaller than the pixel
size of the WF.

[LIEN: This will be noted in TUTORIAL.TXT and in the labels of the GIF
files.] 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
R. Joyner

These are my initial comments on RPX_0001.  If you have any questions,
and I expect that you will, please call and we can work thru any issues.

(1)  ...\CALMASK\*.LBL

     (a)  The COMPRESSED_FILE object is required to have a FILE_RECORDS
          keyword.  I believe we talked about this in one of our
          meetings ???

[Ron agreed this keyword is not really needed.  No change.]

(9)  DATA directories

     (a)  You might consider including a DATA directory at the root
          and making the data directories subdirectories of this one.
          It definitely makes the CD cleaner and it is very obvious
          where to find the data.

[People had differences of opinion over the need for a DATA directory.  
We finally decided not to make this change.]

(10)  DATA/CALIMAGE/*.LBL
          /CALMASK/*.LBL
          /ENGDATA/*.LBL
          /ENGMASK/*.LBL
          /HEADER/*.LBL
          /RAWIMAGE/*.LBL
          /RAWMASK/*.LBL

      (a)  Within these label files, byte offsets are lowercase.
           The standards are unclear on this point.  But, CN has
           decided that the <bytes> units should be either uppercase
           or lowercase.  However, NasaView currently crashes when
           encountering lowercase units.  So, please convert the
           <bytes>  --->>> <BYTES>.  We will fix NasaView later.

[LIEN: We will change.]

(11)  DATA/BROWSE/*.GIF					 - able to view in Internet Explorer
          /CALIMAGE/*.IMG				 - able to view in NasaView
          /CALMASK/*.ZIP				 - able to explode and view
          /ENGDATA/*.ZIP				 - able to explode and view
          /ENGMASK/*.ZIP				 - able to explode and view
          /HEADER/*.ZIP					 - able to explode and view
          /RAWIMAGE/*.ZIP				 - able to explode and view
          /RAWMASK/*.ZIP				 - able to explode and view

      (a) Unzip - when I unzip the files in the RAWMASK directory
          the PKUNZIP program displayes the file names in lowercase.
          The NT operating system displays the unzipped files in
          uppercase.  I have not tested this on UNIX, but I am
          concerned that the files may be created with lowercase
          names ???

[LIEN: We will convert internal file names to upper case.]

      (b) All of the label files require extensive editing in order
          to get NasaView to process the label/data.  None of these
          problems are due to label errors.  The new compressed
          objects are of course a problem that needs to be fixed
          within NasaView.  Other problems include:

          - if the NOTE keyword-value exceeds 60 characters, NasaView
            will crash.
          - some of the other extraneous keywords (either placement
            of or inclusion of) crashes NasaView.

          I think we should include a note in the ERRATA.TXT file
          that the current version of NasaView (2.5.2) cannot
          display the data.

[LIEN: We will make this addition to ERRATA.TXT.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. The data files. I had no problem looking at the browse gif files and
labels. Spot checks indicate that the labels looked consistent with the
images. The calibrated images could be looked at with XV (in its limited
way), but I had to use the IRAF task rfits to copy them to disc in IRAF
format. IRAF would not display the images directly from the CD. The
compressed raw files could be unzipped to disc from the destination
directory.

	So, except for the awkwardness of having to rfits images from
cd in IRAF, things seemed to work. I would be interested in what others
found.

[No change]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
P. Nicholson

I really like all the geometric & photometric parameters you have added
to the PDS labels. I will check some of the photometry numbers tomorrow
against my own notes. Ditto for a few geometry numbers, which Dick
generated for our data. These labels
are also easier to read than the original FITS headers, as they have
all the important info (filter, etc.) up front. 

I also like the mini-images in the browse directory, and the fact
that you have included a solar spectrum and filter profiles.

So far the **ONLY** thing I have found which might be slightly
misleading concerns the methane quad filters with which the bulk of
these data were taken. Strictly, this leads to a different wavelength
for each chip, as the 890 nm portion only covers one chip at a time.
Since sometimes part of Saturn is in an adjacent chip (eg., WF3), this
is seen thru a different methane filter. Is this worth including?
We could figure out from the HST WFPC2 handbook which filter is on
each chip for PC1 or WF3 observations. Right now, your headers
seem to allow for just 1 filter for the whole 4 frames in a file.
Also I presume the calibration data is for the 890 nm filter only;
Pat may not even have that for the other quad segments.

[LIEN: We will change the labels on methane-filter images to indicate
that calibration factors are unknown on un-targeted frames.] 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
P. Nicholson

FITS images:

Since others used IRAF, I should report that I was able to read the
FITS image files in IDL 5.1 using the 'readfits' command, directly from
the disk and with no problems.  

I carefully compared several
specific images from our own Aug and Nov data sets against my own
copies of these images, just to see that everything was labelled
correctly. All checked out OK.  I even found some images I had forgotten
were taken, so the set seems to be very complete.

GIF images:

I think the fact that you have reassembled all 4 images from each
original HST files with their correct orientation and scale in the
GIF images is a good thing. I found a sketch of the WFPC2 layout in one
of the documentation files. Otherwise the 90 deg rotations of the 
individual PC or WF images could be very confusing.  Perhaps you
could note somewhere (in the volume description?) that the
orientation on the sky of the HST FOV switches 180 deg at opposition,
so the May and Aug images are oppositely oriented to the Nov images.
(This is implicit in the CLOCK_ANGLE values, of course.)

[LIEN: We will add a comment about the change in orientation around
opposition to TUTORIAL.TXT.] 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
R. French

1) as I understand it, each of the four images in a WFPC2 exposure has
its own header information, so that Phil's question about different
filters for the four chips is handled header by header, along with the
plate scale for that chip, right?

2) I agree with Amanda that some of the keywords in the headers from
STSCI are not just a little off, but can be VERY far off. THere needs to
be a way to flag this. ORIENTAT is one of these.

[LIEN: We will include warnings about the ORIENTAT keyword in
TUTORIAL.TXT, along with warnings about PHOTFLAM.] 

3) I'd like to compare the I/F conversion factors in the files to what I
computed by integrating over the solar spectrum and using Pat's information
about the filters. I am having trouble reading those headers at the
moment but will check them when I can read them. 

4) I like the idea of having a data directory at the root level. 

[Panel decided not to make this change.]

A. Bosh

  It would be nice if the DOCUMENT/TUTORIAL.TXT could be moved somewhat
    higher to make it easier to find.

[LIEN: We will add comments in AAREADME.TXT to highlight the existence
of this particular file.]

[LIEN: We will fix "anomly".  The format of PSTPTIME has the period, not
the colon, so we will not make this change.  We agree that the
definition of RTAMATCH is cryptic.  However it only appears in header
files and appears unimportant for our purposes.  We will leave it
unchanged but will add a note to the file overall indicating that these
definitions come directly out of the FITS data files and that further
information can be found at the HST web site.]

========================================================================
INDEX directory
========================================================================
 
C. Roddier

My second remark is more important. I think an easy index to
the files is missing. There is an index for each disk and an
index for the whole set in the subdirectories "index", but
they are quite impossible to read. If you display them on the
screen of your computer you have to make an enormous window,
and even like this each image is described in several lines
on the screen. I would call this index the "formal" index and
I think it has to be there. But I am sure potential users would
find useful another index which gives only the most useful
information, so that it is much smaller and easier to read.
In the headers the main part of the information has already been
given many times, and after a while you don't even look at it,
but since it is there, it hides the particular information which
has to be given just for the image described. I have tried to
write down such an index with the information taken in the headers.
I think this index should be in the "browse" directories
for each of these directories and a general one somewhere
on the disks.

I did it for the cd 5 but in fact I realised it was missing when
I looked at the images of the cd3 which are the images of the
August ring plane crossing. Since I had reduced these data,
I had my own notes and images and I compared them to the gif files
of RPX_0003/199508XX/U2TFXXXX which are the images of the proposal
5836 by Nicholson. I was unable to find some of the files that you
(Mark Showalter) had sent to me. When I looked carefully, I found
that these images had been taken in the proposal 6216 by Trauger.
So I had to go to another directory and look at the labels. If I
had not known that these images were in fact taken at the same time
as the Nicholson images I am not sure I would have found them.

I wrote the "easy index" for the CD 5 that I did not know.
Here is an attempt of what I think would be useful:

I think that if you have such an index you can easily see which
are the dates and the filters. A problem is "where are the
images". With all the informations given in the header you
cannot find this information anywhere and you are obliged to
look at the images. In fact if you realize that there is some
kind of code you can derive this information. Here for instance
on some images is written "HST Target name: SATURN-WEST-ANSA".
That means that the image has been taken on PC1 only. On others
is written "HST Target name: SATURN-EAST-ANSA": the image is taken
also on WF4. But the label "SATURN-EAST-ANSA" is wrong since you
have both ansae. I think that since the kind of index I am
proposing is not a "legal" one you could change the legal
appelation "PC1-FIX" which gives only the information that the
image has been taken on the right side of the mosaick by the
appelations "PC1" or "PC1-WF4".

[LIEN: We will create a simpler index file containing only these
critical parameters.  Our goal is to make it less than 132 characters
wide.  More expanded capabilities for selecting images will be available
from the Rings Node catalog.]

(4)  INDEX/INDEX.LBL
           CUMINDEX.LBL

     (a)  You must either rename the FILE_NAME column to
FILE_SPECIFICATION_NAME.
          OR you must separate the directory information from the file name
          and add a column for PATH_NAME.

[LIEN: We will change the name to FILE_SPECIFICATION_NAME.]

(5)  INDEX/OBSCMIDX.LBL
           OBSINDEX.LBL

     (a)  Both of these files contain illegal characters which in
          this case are TABs.

[LIEN: We will fix.]

(7)  Keyword / Value search

     The following invalid keyword-values were found.

     (1)   DATA_SET_ID       HST-S-WFPC2-4-V1.0

		----------------------------------------
		Find 'HST-S-WFPC2-4-V1.0' in 'F:\INDEX\OBSCMIDX.LBL' :
		F:\INDEX\OBSCMIDX.LBL(7): DATA_SET_ID = "HST-S-WFPC2-4-V1.0"
		Found 'HST-S-WFPC2-4-V1.0' 1 time(s).
		----------------------------------------
		Find 'HST-S-WFPC2-4-V1.0' in 'F:\INDEX\OBSINDEX.LBL' :
		F:\INDEX\OBSINDEX.LBL(7): DATA_SET_ID = "HST-S-WFPC2-4-V1.0"
		Found 'HST-S-WFPC2-4-V1.0' 1 time(s).
		Search complete, found 'HST-S-WFPC2-4-V1.0' 2 time(s).

LABEL/EXTTAB.FMT
  Is there a way to indicate somewhere that we have found that some header
    keyword values are not correct.  I think ORIENTAT is one of them.  It
    would be a shame to make others go through this exercise when we already
    know it.

[LIEN: We will warn users about ORIENTAT in TUTORIAL.TXT.]
