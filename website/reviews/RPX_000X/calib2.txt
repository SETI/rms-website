- /CALIB/F130LP.TAB is not CR-LF delimited.

(6)  CALIB/F130LP.TAB

     (a)  This file is only terminated with <LF>.  Once the file is
          terminated with <CR><LF>, and ROW_BYTES = 23 is set, then
          the file displays correctly.  But, there is a problem with
          NASAVIEW displaying this file for some reason.  It displays
          correctly using TBTOOL.

[LIEN: We will fix.]
