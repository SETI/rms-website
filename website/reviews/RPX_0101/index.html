Thank you very much to the dedicated individuals who submitted peer reviews.The final version is on line as an expanded directory tree<a href="/cds/RPX_0101/">RPX_0101</a> or as a single, downloadable zip file<a href="/zips/RPX_0101.zip">RPX_0101.zip</a> (246 Mbytes).<h2>Overview of Changes</h2>The most extensive set of changes since the peer review releasehave been as follows:<p>In response to recommendations from the peer reviewers the directory structure supporting the data files has been reorganized. There is now a /DATA directory in the root directory with separate subdirectories for /IMAGES and /SPECTRA. <p>A new DATAINFO.TXT file has been included in the /DATA directory. It gives general information about the files within the subdirectories. Items covered include: <ul><li>A simple table using the roots of the filenames for the ISIS spectra in the DATA/SPECTRA/RAWISIS & DATA/SPECTRA/CALISIS subdirectories. The table identifies the target (E Ring or Enceladus), and whether the product was obtained through the blue or the red arm of the spectrograph.<li>A table giving the minimum and maximum zenith angles for the collection of files within each of the /DATA/IMAGE subdirectories. Additional information is provided to enable a user to quickly determine the actual zenith angle range for any given image.<li>Additionally, the /DATA/DATAINFO.TXT file contains a brief discussion of the orientation of the images in the /DATA/IMAGES/RAWIMAGE & /DATA/IMAGES/CALIMAGE subdirectories. The discussion is supported by three low resolution GIF images in the /DATA directory.</ul><p>Separate CALINFO.TXT files were added to each of the subdirectories under the /CALIB directory. Included in these files are simple tables which identify the purpose of each file in that subdirectory. The tables also summarize some additional information such as, for ISIS calibration files, which arm was used, and for API calibration files, filter and exposure duration. <p>Labels have been rewritten to contain more complete information and toshow greater consistency from directory to directory.<p><h2>Detailed Responses to Reviewers' Comments</h2>Follow these links for each reviewer's comments and my detailed, point-by-pointresponse.
