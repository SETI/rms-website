From: James M Bauer [bauer@scn.jpl.nasa.gov]Sent: Friday, June 06, 2003 3:59 PMThis report concerns the initial review of the WHT 1995 Saturn RPX data for the PDS archive. I've been able to access all the CD files on both Linux and Solaris.  Some catalog data made the filemanager on Solaris crash, but that is likely owing to a bug in the Solaris software rather than the archive, as the data is entirely accessible through command line input. At first look, the data archive seems comprehendible, organized, and complete. Clearly much work has gone into the archiving process, and the archivers should be commended for their efforts. The following optional suggestions may be helpful (7 listed):1) Enceladus spectral data may be best listed in a separate directory,          apart from the e_ring data, or change the name of the directory to indicate that both spectral data are included.2) The following references may also be of interest, and might be appropriately appended to the ref.cat file at the archiver's discretion (listed here in BibTeX format):@ARTICLE{2000Icar..148..397M,    author = {{Momary}, T.~W. and {Baines}, K.~H. and {Yanamandra-Fisher}, P.~A. and {Lebofsky}, L.~A. and {Golisch}, W. and {Kaminski}, C.},    title = "{The Saturnian Satellites in the Near-Infrared: Absolute Photometry at Ring Plane Crossing}",    journal = {Icarus},    year = 2000,    month = dec,    volume = 148,    pages = {397-406},    adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000Icar..148..397M&db_key=AST},    adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}}@ARTICLE{2000Icar..145..147P,    author = {{Poulet}, F. and {Sicardy}, B. and {Dumas}, C. and {Jorda}, L. and {Tiph{\` e}ne}, D.},    title = "{The Crossings of Saturn Ring Plane by the Earth in 1995: Ring Thickness}",    journal = {Icarus},    year = 2000,    month = may,    volume = 145,    pages = {147-165},    adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000Icar..145..147P&db_key=AST},    adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}}@ARTICLE{2000Icar..143..299R,    author = {{Roddier}, F. and {Roddier}, C. and {Brahic}, A. and {Dumas}, C. and {Graves}, J.~E. and {Northcott}, M.~J. and {Owen}, T.},    title = "{Adaptive Optics Observations of Saturn's Ring Plane Crossing in August 1995}",    journal = {Icarus},    year = 2000,    month = feb,    volume = 143,    pages = {299-307},    adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000Icar..143..299R&db_key=AST},    adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}}@ARTICLE{1999JGR...10424095P,    author = {{Poulet}, F. and {Karoschka}, E. and {Sicardy}, B.},    title = "{Spectrophotometry of Saturn's small satellites and rings from Hubble Space Telescope images}",    journal = {\jgr},    year = 1999,    month = oct,    volume = 104,    pages = {24095-24110},    adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1999JGR...10424095P&db_key=AST},    adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}}@ARTICLE{1998Icar..136..223B,    author = {{Buratti}, B.~J. and {Mosher}, J.~A. and {Nicholson}, P.~D. and 	{McGhee}, C.~A. and {French}, R.~G.},    title = "{Near-Infrared Photometry of the Saturnian Satellites during Ring Plane Crossing}",    journal = {Icarus},    year = 1998,    month = dec,    volume = 136,    pages = {223-231},    adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998Icar..136..223B&db_key=AST},    adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}}@ARTICLE{1998Icar..131..152T,    author = {{Throop}, H.~B. and {Esposito}, L.~W.},    title = "{G Ring Particle Sizes Derived from Ring Plane Crossing Observations}",    journal = {Icarus},    year = 1998,    month = jan,    volume = 131,    pages = {152-166},    adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998Icar..131..152T&db_key=AST},    adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}}@ARTICLE{1997Icar..125..440B,    author = {{Bauer}, J. and {Lissauer}, J.~J. and {Simon}, M.},    title = "{Edge-on Observations of Saturn's E and G Rings in the Near-IR}",    journal = {Icarus},    year = 1997,    month = feb,    volume = 125,    pages = {440-445},    adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1997Icar..125..440B&db_key=AST},    adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}}@ARTICLE{1996Icar..121..195D,    author = {{de Pater}, I. and {Showalter}, M.~R. and {Lissauer}, J.~J. and 	{Graham}, J.~R.},    title = "{Keck Infrared Observations of Saturn's E and G Rings during Earth's 1995 Ring Plane Crossings}",    journal = {Icarus},    year = 1996,    month = may,    volume = 121,    pages = {195-198},    adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1996Icar..121..195D&db_key=AST},    adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}}@ARTICLE{1995Icar..117..212I,    author = {{Ip}, W.-H.},    title = "{Implications of meteoroid-ring interactions for observations of the 1995 Saturn ring plane crossing.}",    journal = {Icarus},    year = 1995,    month = sep,    volume = 117,    pages = {212-215},    adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1995Icar..117..212I&db_key=AST},    adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}}3) Some of the "TARGET" keywords in the e_ring/easyisis data are 		labeled as merely "SATURN". In light of the two separate data sets of E-ring and Enceladus data, it may be clearer to label these keywords as "ENCELADUS" and "ERING", or an obvious variant.4) it may be helpful to add the EXPOSURE_DURATION keywords and values to the e_ring/easyisis/e[n-r]*.lbl files. Where any absolute flux calibration seems hopeless owing to the weather & seeing, the exposure times may give an idea of what kind of S/N should be expected. These are available in the raw data files, so this is not critical, but may be helpful.5) index/indexinfo.txt = index/indxinfo.txt ... missing 'e'? 6) I was able to plot e-ring spectra and analyze mainring images. The calibration images have as TARGET_NAME keyword entries "N/A". Especially for the standard star images, it may be helpful to include the standard star designation (SAO, HD, or Landolt) as the TARGET_NAME keyword (instead of or in addition to the "FEATURE_NAME"), since this keyword is more descriptive of what is being observed.  7) It was difficult to find an airmass value or zenith angle w/o          airmass donerunning a lookup program for each standard, which would be helpful in reductions for extinction coefficients and offsets, or at least for the user to determine for themselves how poor or good the data set photometry quality is. I may have missed it, but if so, it may be useful to add to the header.Regards,-James Bauer (gerbs)
