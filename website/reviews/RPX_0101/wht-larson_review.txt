Used the aareadme treatment to fix the line termination for UNIX and got the same error. The .lbl file claims good fits format (2880 byte blocks) and # records in header. Does it matter that the header is ascii and the images is binary? I seem to recall that fits images in the PDS/SBN required concatenating header and image files that IRAF could then display, but that is not the case here. IRAF does not display the headers with the imhead command. Looks like a problem recognizing the files within IRAF. Unfortunately, I am not aware of any other fits display on my Linux machine. I had this same problem with the images in the calib, e_ring and mainring directories. Maybe I am doing something dumb.I had no problem seeing the gif browse images. I looked at all the ascii files (.lbl, .txt, .tab,.cat, etc) and they seem to be in order and provide very useful information (I learned some things about the WHT from insthost.cat).Calib: calinfo.txt the .lbl files have all the necessary entries to understand the flat-field image files. Was very happy to see PDF files included showing the filter curves, although some of the .ps files would crash the Red Hat Linus "Konqueror". This may be a problem with my machine, and I can access all the .pdf equivalents.Let me know if there is something I should do and I will finish this review before your deadline. Best wishes for the holidays.-Steve======================================================From: Steve Larson [slarson@pirl.lpl.Arizona.EDU]Sent: Monday, December 29, 2003 9:43 AMTo: mgordon@mail.arc.nasa.govCc: slarson@pirlserver.lpl.arizona.eduSubject: RE: WHT Ring Plane Crossing ArchiveMitch- By copying CDROM images to disc, I can access the images from DS9 and 		corrected header problem?read the headers, but not through IRAF. It is entirely possible that I have a corrupted IRAF, and I will be looking into that next week. In principle, I still think that one should be able to access the data directly from the CDROM rather than to have to copy them to disc first. For now, I can say that looking at about 40 images in the ering and mainring/ rawimages, I did not note one problem (Gawd those WHT headers are long - a clear challenge to the HST headers ;-) I think the WHT disc is ready for prime time.I will be out of email contact for the next three days, but let me know if you need more on this.Happy New Year!-Steve
