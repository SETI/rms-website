It looks to be in very good shape; the observers and the PDS have taken great care to keep things neat and organized. Everything that I looked for is there, from a description of the instrument and telescope to the production details of the calibrated data. I found the mission objectives to be particularly useful; putting myself in the place of an interested scientist 20 years from now, one of the first things I might want to know is what the observer was looking for.I went though all of the raw, calibrated, and gif images using the Linux program "xv" to display the data. I also scanned all of the text files to get an overview of what comprises the data set. Everything appears to be in order. Below I have collected miscellaneous comments, all of them minor, that could be addressed. None of them should require much effort.Again, apologies on the tardiness of this review.Cheers,DougDIRECTORY: /MAINRING/CALIMAGE  These files, created on Dec 3 2003, don't seem to be part of the data set. Should they be removed?cim-grepmr-ci-listmr-ci-list~DIRECTORY: /E_RING/CALISISI was not able to display these images:F161237C.IMG			F161238C.IMG										F161245C.IMG										F161246C.IMG										DIRECTORY:  /CALIB/APIThese images below can be displayed, but they appear garbled.
