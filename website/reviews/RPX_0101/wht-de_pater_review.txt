From: Imke de Pater [imke@astron.berkeley.edu]Sent: Monday, November 10, 2003 12:05 PMMitch, Mark:I went through it; here is a review:--Review of the CD containing the WHT ring plane crossing data.The file aareadme.txt contains all the relevant information that one needs to examine the contents of the CD, with pointers as where to find more detailed information on specific files. I made a number a point-checks to such files, and did not see anything obviously missing from the information.Mainring:The browse files are good to include, but because of the low contrast ring-planet the usefulness is quite limited. It is extremely hard to catch both details of the ring s and planet in the same image.The images  are therefore much  more useful. The cal-images  read fine into  IDL.   If  one  would   prefer  to  redo  the  calibration,  all information  is  contained in  the  calib  directory.  That is  filter profiles are given in pdf and  ps format. I noticed that i_rgo.ps came    out half, while the pdf file contained the entire profile.E-Ring:The easyisis/ contains spectra.Raw data and calibration files are also included.Suggestions for improvements:I had problems in identifying files for calibration purposes.  It 	would be useful to have a simple file indicating what the various images/files for calibration purposes are, such as sky, calibrator star, which star, etc; both for the images and spectra. Also, the labels of the processed imagesspectral files appear to be 2D in raw form; is the final product integrated over this?I hope this is helpful,Imke
