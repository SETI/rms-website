They have been removed.> DIRECTORY: /E_RING/CALISIS > I was not able to display these images:> > F161237C.IMG> F161238C.IMG> F161245C.IMG> F161246C.IMGWe identified and corrected an error in the labels that prevented display for some software. > DIRECTORY:  /CALIB/API> > These images below can be displayed, but they appear garbled. Can> the observer comment on what has happened here?> > F161074R.IMG> F161076R.IMG> F161077R.IMGThese were bad files (problems with the observations). Each was identified by the observers at the time and duplicate observations were made. The corrupted files have been removed from the data set.> SPELLING ERRORS:> > CATALOG/APIINST.CAT   occuppied -> occupied> CATALOG/DATASET.CAT   substraction ->  subtraction> DOCUMENT/OBS_LOG.TXT  seening -> seeing> DOCUMENT/OBS_LOG.TXT  substraction ->  subtraction> DOCUMENT/FITSINFO.ASC>   exampleof>   valuesmay>   anticipatedthat>   AnimportantAll have been corrected, except those in FITSINFO.ASC which was originally published elsewhere and is include here 'as is'. > Why is the "Title:" field in CATALOG/DATASET.CAT "Unknown" for the WHT> proposal? Can this be tracked down?Neither the P.I. nor any member of the team can provide a title. This data set was the result of a proposal to the U.K. Particle Physics and Astronomy Panel. Different forms and procedures than in the U.S. There may never have been a "title" for the proposal.
