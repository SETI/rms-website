I've been able to access all the CD files on > both Linux and Solaris. Some catalog data made the filemanager on > Solaris crash, but that is likely owing to a bug in the Solaris  > software rather than the archive, as the data is entirely accessible  > through command line input. At first look, the data archive seems > comprehendible, organized, and complete. Clearly much work has gone  > into the archiving process, and the archivers should be commended for > their efforts. The following optional suggestions may be helpful > (7 listed): > 1) Enceladus spectral data may be best listed in a separate > directory, apart from the e_ring data, or change the name of the > directory to indicate that both spectral data are included.We introduced a high level 'DATA' directory with separate subdirectories for 'IMAGES' & 'SPECTRA'. We provide a DATAINFO.TXT file in the DATA directory. The file includes a simple table identifying which files are associated with the E Ring and which with Enceladus.  > 2) The following references (appended at the end of this document) > may also be of interest, and might be appropriately appended to the > ref.cat file at the archiver's discretion (listed here in BibTeX > format).All have been added to the REF.CAT file and the PDS central reference catalog.> 3) Some of the "TARGET" keywords in the e_ring/easyisis data are> labeled as merely "SATURN". In light of the two separate data sets of> E-ring and Enceladus data, it may be clearer to label these keywords> as "ENCELADUS" and "ERING", or an obvious variant.The values for the three related keywords, TARGET_TYPE, TARGET_NAME, and FEATURE_NAME have been updated in each label to more accurately reflect the target of the give file. > 4) it may be helpful to add the EXPOSURE_DURATION keywords and values> to the e_ring/easyisis/e[n-r]*.lbl files. Where any absolute flux> calibration seems hopeless owing to the weather & seeing, the exposure> times may give an idea of what kind of S/N should be expected. These> are available in the raw data files, so this is not critical, but may> be helpful. Done.> 5) index/indexinfo.txt = index/indxinfo.txt ... missing 'e'?This is the standard form for the name of this file - dates back to the times when filenames were restricted to 8.3 characters.> 6) I was able to plot e-ring spectra and analyze mainring images. The> calibration images have as TARGET_NAME keyword entries> "N/A". Especially for the standard star images, it may be helpful to> include the standard star designation (SAO, HD, or Landolt) as the> TARGET_NAME keyword (instead of or in addition to the "FEATURE_NAME"),> since this keyword is more descriptive of what is being observed. This has been corrected, see item 3) above.> 7) It was difficult to find an airmass value or zenith angle w/o> running a lookup program for each standard, which would be helpful in> reductions for extinction coefficients and offsets, or at least for> the user to determine for themselves how poor or good the data set> photometry quality is. I may have missed it, but if so, it may be> useful to add to the header.AIRMASS which is a PDS defined keyword has been added to the labels. However zenith angle is not included in the PDS data dictionary. The DATAINFO.TXT file in the DATA directory now contains a simple table which for each subdirectory provides the  range of zenith angles for the files in that  subdirectory.  It also identifies the keywords in the image FITS headers which give the specific values for each image. > Regards,> > -James Bauer (gerbs)> > >  Additional references:>> @ARTICLE{2000Icar..148..397M,>     author = {{Momary}, T.~W. and {Baines}, K.~H. and {Yanamandra-Fisher},> P.~A. and {Lebofsky}, L.~A. and {Golisch}, W. and {Kaminski}, C.},>     title = "{The Saturnian Satellites in the Near-Infrared: Absolute> Photometry at Ring Plane Crossing}",>     journal = {Icarus},>     year = 2000,>     month = dec,>     volume = 148,>     pages = {397-406},>     adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-> bib_query?bibcode=2000Icar..148..397M&db_key=AST},>     adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}> }> > @ARTICLE{2000Icar..145..147P,>     author = {{Poulet}, F. and {Sicardy}, B. and {Dumas}, C. and {Jorda},> L. and {Tiph{\` e}ne}, D.},>     title = "{The Crossings of Saturn Ring Plane by the Earth in 1995:> Ring Thickness}",>     journal = {Icarus},>     year = 2000,>     month = may,>     volume = 145,>     pages = {147-165},>     adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-> bib_query?bibcode=2000Icar..145..147P&db_key=AST},>     adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}> }> > @ARTICLE{2000Icar..143..299R,>     author = {{Roddier}, F. and {Roddier}, C. and {Brahic}, A. and> {Dumas}, C. and {Graves}, J.~E. and {Northcott}, M.~J. and {Owen}, T.},>     title = "{Adaptive Optics Observations of Saturn's Ring Plane Crossing> in August 1995}",>     journal = {Icarus},>     year = 2000,>     month = feb,>     volume = 143,>     pages = {299-307},>     adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-> bib_query?bibcode=2000Icar..143..299R&db_key=AST},>     adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}> }> > @ARTICLE{1999JGR...10424095P,>     author = {{Poulet}, F. and {Karoschka}, E. and {Sicardy}, B.},>     title = "{Spectrophotometry of Saturn's small satellites and rings> from Hubble Space Telescope images}",>     journal = {\jgr},>     year = 1999,>     month = oct,>     volume = 104,>     pages = {24095-24110},>     adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-> bib_query?bibcode=1999JGR...10424095P&db_key=AST},>     adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}> }> > @ARTICLE{1998Icar..136..223B,>     author = {{Buratti}, B.~J. and {Mosher}, J.~A. and {Nicholson}, P.~D.> and> 	{McGhee}, C.~A. and {French}, R.~G.},>     title = "{Near-Infrared Photometry of the Saturnian Satellites during> Ring Plane Crossing}",>     journal = {Icarus},>     year = 1998,>     month = dec,>     volume = 136,>     pages = {223-231},>     adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-> bib_query?bibcode=1998Icar..136..223B&db_key=AST},>     adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}> }> > @ARTICLE{1998Icar..131..152T,>     author = {{Throop}, H.~B. and {Esposito}, L.~W.},>     title = "{G Ring Particle Sizes Derived from Ring Plane Crossing> Observations}",>     journal = {Icarus},>     year = 1998,>     month = jan,>     volume = 131,>     pages = {152-166},>     adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-> bib_query?bibcode=1998Icar..131..152T&db_key=AST},>     adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}> }> > @ARTICLE{1997Icar..125..440B,>     author = {{Bauer}, J. and {Lissauer}, J.~J. and {Simon}, M.},>     title = "{Edge-on Observations of Saturn's E and G Rings in the Near-> IR}",>     journal = {Icarus},>     year = 1997,>     month = feb,>     volume = 125,>     pages = {440-445},>     adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-> bib_query?bibcode=1997Icar..125..440B&db_key=AST},>     adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}> }> > @ARTICLE{1996Icar..121..195D,>     author = {{de Pater}, I. and {Showalter}, M.~R. and {Lissauer}, J.~J.> and> 	{Graham}, J.~R.},>     title = "{Keck Infrared Observations of Saturn's E and G Rings during> Earth's 1995 Ring Plane Crossings}",>     journal = {Icarus},>     year = 1996,>     month = may,>     volume = 121,>     pages = {195-198},>     adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-> bib_query?bibcode=1996Icar..121..195D&db_key=AST},>     adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}> }> > @ARTICLE{1995Icar..117..212I,>     author = {{Ip}, W.-H.},>     title = "{Implications of meteoroid-ring interactions for observations> of the 1995 Saturn ring plane crossing.}",>     journal = {Icarus},>     year = 1995,>     month = sep,>     volume = 117,>     pages = {212-215},>     adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-> bib_query?bibcode=1995Icar..117..212I&db_key=AST},>     adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}> }
