Included in these files are simple tables identifying the purpose and some additional information for each file in that subdirectory.> Also, the spectral files appear to be 2D in raw form; is the final > product integrated over this?Yes. We expanded the DESCRIPTION keyword value in the label for each calibrated ISIS spectra to explicitly describe what was done. > I hope this is helpful, > Imke
