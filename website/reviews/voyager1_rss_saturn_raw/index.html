<h1>Raw Radio Science Data from the Voyager 1 Radio Occultation at Saturn</h1>
Review facilitated by the Ring-Moon Systems Node of NASA PDS: Mia Mace, Matt Tiscareno<br>
May, 2025
</br>
<br>The data provider is Richard A. Simpson.</br>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
This bundle contains open-loop radio receiver data collected at the
Madrid (Spain) 64-m antenna of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSS-63)
during the Voyager 1 encounter with Saturn on day 1980/318. The data
include samples from receiver outputs at S-band (13 cm wavelength)
and X-band (3.6 cm) in right- and left-circular polarization.  Also
included are calibration measurements collected within a few hours
of the Saturn observations.

<p>
527 original data tapes (known as Original Data Records, or ODRs)
were delivered to the Voyager Radio Science Team in the RSC-11-6
binary format.  Each original tape forms the basis for a PDS4 product
in the bundle.  The binary file is the first part of the product; but
the binary data have been converted to ASCII for easier reading.
There is one ASCII file with record header data and one ASCII file
with the receiver samples.  These are the second and third parts of
each PDS4 product.  Each product also includes a detached PDS4 label
file wrtten in XML.

<p>
In a small number of cases, records could not be read from the ODR
tape that was delivered to the Voyager Radio Science Team.  A
replacement record has been substituted.  Bytes 43 and 44 in the
replacement record header have been set to '1', and the 5000 receiver
output samples in the record have been set to '127'.

<p>
Each ODR has been processed to give a 'browse' product with a
histogram of data sample values, a plot of average sample power versus
time, and a plot of time-averaged power spectra.  There are 527 browse
products, each in PDF/A-1b format.

<p>
Also included in the bundle are reconstructions of the spacecraft
trajectory and spacecraft high-gain antenna pointing, which was offset
during the Saturn atmospheric occultation to compensate for refraction.
A receiver tuning file allows calculation of the exact received
frequency at the ground station.  

<p>A document collection includes a description of the Voyager mission,
the radio science operations plan for the Voyager 1 Saturn/Titan encounter, 
and a Software Interface Specification (SIS) for the archive bundle. 
Documentation of the binary formats in the ODR and receiver tuning binary
files, which has been archived elsewhere in PDS, have been included by reference.

<p>
<em> Note: This information is provided in the bundle's readme.txt </em>

</p>

<h3>Data Bundle</h3>

<p><b>The complete peer review bundle (voyager1_rss_saturn_raw.tar.gz) is online <a href="/review-data/voyager1_rss_saturn_raw">here</a>. Also provided are the checksum manifest and validation report; these latter two files are primarily for reviewers concerned with PDS4-compliance (see instructions below).</b>

<p><b>Reviewers should begin by reading the readme.txt file (top level of the bundle). The Software Interface Specification (SIS) is included in the document collection and provides detailed descriptions of the archive bundle.</b>

<h3>Instructions for Reviewers</h3>
<p>
Here are guidelines and some information to help you produce an effective review with a reasonable level of effort.
</p>

All reviewers must address two general areas:
<ul>
<li> Scientific merit of data (are these the proper data to be archived?),
<li> Usability of the data (appropriate formats; completeness of data set, including ancillary data; comprehensive documentation).
</ul>

Furthermore, if you are one of the panel members with a direct affiliation with the PDS, please also address a third general area:
<ul>
<li> Compliance with PDS4 Standards.
</ul>
If you are <b>not</b> one of the panel members with a direct affiliation with the PDS, then you do <b>not</b> need to address compliance with PDS4 standards. Rather, you should focus on the data (including ancillary data) and documentation.
<p>
While it is not realistic for you to analyze every data file, please check enough to convince yourself of the quality and consistency of the data and of any errors that you encounter.
</p>
<p>
Please also evaluate the documentation provided in individual table labels, and referenced journal articles. Much of the information contained in the referenced articles is not duplicated in the data sets.
</p>
<p>
Questions for reviewers to address are:
<ul>
<li> Documentation:
<ul>
<li> Does the documentation explain the data and how they were produced?
<li> Does the documentation explain how to use the data?
<li> Is the documentation (including referenced journal articles) sufficient to ensure the data will be intelligible to a scientist 10, 20, or 50 years in the future?
</ul>
<li> Data:
<ul>
<li> Are you able to manipulate and plot the data, interpret columns into tables, and understand the context and relationships of the data products?
<li> Are there any concerns about the creation/generation, calibration (if appropriate), or general usability of the data? 
<li> Is the archive design suitable (is the directory tree structured in a reasonable way)?
</ul>
</ul>
The review panel submits written reviews by email and then, if the RMS Node thinks it is necessary, participates in a teleconference (date TBD) to discuss the reviews, including strengths and weaknesses of the data set. Specific shortcomings and errors will be identified as "liens" &ndash; questions about or requests for change &ndash;  which will need to be corrected. The review panel is responsible for making a recommendation on whether:
<ul>
<li> The bundle/s passed peer review and can be archived, once a set of panel identified liens have been resolved.
<li> The material did not pass peer review, and must undergo an incremental (delta) review in certain specified areas.
<li> The material did not pass peer review, and must undergo another full peer review.
<li> The material did not pass peer review, and does not merit a second peer review.
</ul>

<p>
In addition to an overall recommendation, the RMS Node will compile a list of liens in the archive design or sample products/bundle. The liens must be resolved before the associated data set can be archived.
</p>

<p></p>

</code>
These refer to Voyager 1 being described as 'Equipment' rather than 'Spacecraft'. This is because Voyager 1 is the 'target' of spacecraft engineering 'observations'. That is, the onboard engineering system is monitoring the status of the spacecraft. So, even though Voyager 1 is participating in observations of Saturn, the engineering system doesn't know that; its target is the spacecraft itself. 
RMS is submitting an SCR to discuss dual use context products for discussion within DDWG and CCB (in-prep). 
</li>

<li>Minor issue &ndash; typos in software.xml: "<b>FORTERAN</b> 77 <b>sourcew</b> code ..." </li>
</ul>


<p>These known issues will be resolved during lien resolution, along with any other issues raised by the reviewers and deemed reasonable/necessary.
