Mitch/Mark, I've completed my review of this new collection.  I 
couldn't be as thorough as with Saturn, but I got to review all 
the documentation, labels, links, catalogs, etc..  I think it is a 
magnificent collection and future users will appreciate the 
comprehensive and careful approach you've taken.  Personally, now 
I don't have to remember all that stuff anymore, you've documented 
it all!

Here are a few comments:

  *   There are a few misspellings:  'metadata' in PROCESSING.TXT 
      (in the last section, I think), 'discrepancy' in ERRATA.TXT 
      section 6, and 'intrinsic' in the _GEOMED.LBL's.
      
  *   The TUTORIAL and DATASET.CAT indicate that 'ADESPIKE' was 
      used.  PROCESSING.TXT says 'DESPIKE'.
      
  *   I was impressed by the thorough understanding and handling 
      of the dark current issue.  The techniques used to provide 
      the proper dark currents for all conditions were very well 
      thought out and implemented.  The description of the complexity 
      of the issue (particularly with Neptune) was well done.
      
  *   The usage of quality control steps was good to see (I don't 
      remember that from Saturn).  The method used was good and 
      this gives me confidence that the set has consistent quality 
      and that special cases have been caught/handled.

I know this report is kinda slim, but there was not much to take 
issue with.  Congratulations to the team for a great job!

Charlie
