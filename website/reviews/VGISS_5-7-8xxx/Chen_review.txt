Hi, Mitch, here are my comments. If these datasets pass peer review,
please let me know, as it will be my job to update the data dictionary as
described at the bottom.

Richard

*/CATALOG/*INST.CAT
INSTRUMENT_TYPE =3D "VIDICON CAMERA". EN currently has this as "CAMERA". Not
sure which is better.

*/CATALOG/MISSION.CAT
The current version at EN has many more targets (e.g. the various moons)
and
1 more reference, KOHLHASE&PENZO1977. If you want the latest version, I can
retrieve it.

*/DATA/*/*.LBL
INSTRUMENT_NAME =3D "IMAGING SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM - WIDE ANGLE CAMERA" should be
INSTRUMENT_NAME =3D "IMAGING SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM - WIDE ANGLE", and
INSTRUMENT_NAME =3D "IMAGING SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM - NARROW ANGLE CAMERA" should
be INSTRUMENT_NAME =3D "IMAGING SCIENCE SUBSYSTEM - NARROW ANGLE"
Keyword INSTRUMENT_HOST_NAME is required but missing.

*/DATA/C14993XX/C14993_GEOMA.LBL (and maybe all _GEOMA.LBL)
ROWS =3D 576 for both the binary and the ascii tables. However, the ascii
file has only 552 rows. The binary file also has odd values starting in
row 551, very likely wrong especially at row 576.

*/DOCUMENT/VICAR.LBL
Line 13: DOCUMENT_FORMAT =3D ASCII is legal but new. Use TEXT?

VGISS_5*/CATALOG/DATASET.CAT
TARGET_NAME =3D "THETACAR": this target is unknown, i.e. it needs a
target.cat

VGISS_5*/CATALOG/REF.CAT
- "and" before final author of SMITHETAL1979A, SMITHETAL1979B,
SMITHETAL1981,
SMITHETAL1982, SMITHETAL1986B, SMITHETAL1989
- SMITHETAL1989 has an extra comma right after the first author

VGISS_5119_peer_review/DATA/C16730XX/C1673012_CALIB.LBL and 800+ others
VGISS_5120_peer_review/DATA/C17363XX/C1736313_CALIB.LBL and 800+ others
VGISS_5214_peer_review/DATA/C20759XX/C2075939_CALIB.LBL and 900+ others
TARGET_NAME =3D "CALLAMPS" is unknown. Probably replace with "CAL LAMPS"

VGISS_5120_peer_review
VGISS_5214_peer_review
VGISS_7207_peer_review
VGISS_8210_peer_review
To verify, only these volumes have directory CALIB/

VGISS_5214_peer_review/CALIB/MIPL/FICOR77_VG2_WA_CH4_U.LBL
FILTER_NAME =3D "CH4_U". I assume this is correct, but please verify since
no other labels in VGISS_5* use this.

VGISS_7*/CATALOG/DATASET.CAT
TARGET_NAME =3D "1985U1" is unknown. Create a TARGET.CAT.
TARGET_NAME =3D "CALLAMPS" is unknown. Probably replace with "CAL LAMPS"
TARGET_NAME =3D "OTHER" is also unknown. Can you choose an existing one?

VGISS_7*/DOCUMENT/FILTERS/DOCINFO.TXT
Line 43: VGn_cc_name.HTM
Line 45: VGn_cc_name.GIF
You could change to VG2_..., as VGISS_8*/DOCUMENT/FILTERS/DOCINFO.TXT have

VGISS_720[567]_peer_review/DATA/.../*.LBL
TARGET_NAME =3D "U_RINGS" should be "U RINGS"

VGISS_7207_peer_review/DATA/C27190XX/C2719055_CALIB.LBL and many others
TARGET_NAME =3D "CALLAMP" should be "CAL LAMPS"

VGISS_8*/CATALOG/DATASET.CAT
TARGET_NAME =3D "1985N1" is unknown. Create a TARGET.CAT
TARGET_NAME =3D "1985N2" is unknown. Create a TARGET.CAT
TARGET_NAME =3D "BETACMA" is unknown. Probably replace with "BETA CMA"
TARGET_NAME =3D "CALLAMPS" is unknown. Probably replace with "CAL LAMPS"
TARGET_NAME =3D "SIGMASGR" is unknown. Probably replace with "SIGMA SGR"

VGISS_8*/CATALOG/REF.CAT
- SMITHETAL1989 has a space between some authors' initials and is missing
"and" before the final author.
- SCIENCEV246N4936 was published in 1989, not 1986

VGISS_8201_peer_review/DATA/C09027XX/C0902741_CLEANED.LBL & 7 others
VGISS_82*/DATA/* have ~150 other such files
REFLECTANCE_SCALING_FACTOR =3D 2.3900E+00 exceeds max of 1.0

VGISS_8207_peer_review/DATA/C11384XX/C1138406_CALIB.LBL & 173 others
TARGET_NAME =3D "SIGMASG" is unknown. Replace with "SIGMA SGR"?

VGISS_8207_peer_review/DATA/C11396XX/C1139643_CALIB.LBL & 29 others
TARGET_NAME =3D "BETACMA" is unknown. Probably replace with "BETA CMA"

VGISS_8210_peer_review/CALIB/MIPL/CALINFO.TXT
DATA_SET_ID =3D "VG1/VG2-N-ISS-2/3/4/6-PROCESSED-V1.0" should be
DATA_SET_ID =3D "VG2-N-ISS-2/3/4/6-PROCESSED-V1.0"

VGISS_8210_peer_review/DATA/C12048XX/C1204820_CALIB.LBL & others
TARGET_NAME =3D "SCORPIU" is unknown. Replace with "SCORPIUS"?

VGISS_8210_peer_review/DATA/C12050XX/C1205010_CALIB.LBL & others
TARGET_NAME =3D "PLEIADE" is unknown. Replace with "PLEIADES"?

VGISS_8210_peer_review/DATA/C12414XX/C1241445_CALIB.LBL & others
TARGET_NAME =3D "CALLAMP" is unknown. Probably replace with "CAL LAMPS"
