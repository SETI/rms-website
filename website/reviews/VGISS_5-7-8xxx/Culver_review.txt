Hi Mitch,

Thanks for including me in this peer review.  I'm impressed at all the 
work that has gone into these volumes!  Overall I think they look very 
good.  Here are my detailed findings.  Feel free to contact me if 
anything isn't clear, or you have questions.

Completeness & Documentation:

  *   The documentation, seems clear, accessible, consistent and 
      complete.    It's very comprehensive given the age of the data, 
      and processing descriptions are accessible and useful,  both now 
      and for future image-processing savvy users.  I found it very 
      easy to get familiar with the data set layout and dig into the 
      data.
      
  *   The ancillary data provided with the data sets seems complete. 
      From browse products to calibration support files, the files are 
      easy to locate and straightforward to use.

  *   In the TUTORIAL.TXT, user is directed to ignore the 224 line 
      prefix bytes in RAW files as not useful, but perhaps a reference 
      to the documentation on the raw CD volumes would be helpful 
      (especially because that structure isn't described elsewhere on 
      the new volumes.)

  *   MIPL is now the Multimission "Instrument" Processing Lab, no 
      longer "Image".  Several documents need to be updated.

Compliance with PDS Standards:

  *   I ran vtool on VGISS_7207.  When using pdsdd.text from the 
      DOCUMENT directory, Vtool failed due to  theTEXT object starting 
      on line 6.  When that object was removed, there were still 
      numerous warnings (see attached, uniquely sorted list of 
      warnings).  Given that keywords aren't explicitly addressed 
      elsewhere in the documentation (as would otherwise occur in a 
      modern Software Interface Specification (SIS) ), I suggest these 
      warnings be resolved.  For reference, here's how I called Vtool 
      (the pdsdd.full is the 7/11/13 version):

      vtool-2.3.0/bin/VTool VGISS_7207_peer_review/DATA/C27*/*LBL -d pdsdd.full, VGISS_7207_peer_review/DOCUMENT/PDSDD.TXT -I VGISS_7207_peer_review/DOCUMENT/ -a -v 2 -r VGISS_7207_peer_review_vtool.rpt

  *    In the INDEX.TAB, the *RESLOC.DAT/.TAB products are mis-
      identified as *RESLOC.IMG.  Recommend they be handled the way 
      the *GEOMA.DAT/.TAB products are treated in the index (I.e. a 
      single entry for the .DAT file), or somehow explained.   Also, 
      it would be helpful to clarify the single index entry for the 
      .DAT/.TAB products in the INDXINFO.TXT.

Compatibility with VICAR software:

  *   I tested a sampling of  .IMG, .DAT and blemish files using 
      VICAR.  All worked as expected with a variety of programs.

Assessment of image processing:

  *   Sometimes the "cleaned" version of the image exacerbates 
      artifacts and removes detailed information due to interpolation. 
      For example,

     *   on VGISS_7207, the C2700224* cleaned image (and those 
         subsequently processed) include smear along limb of Uranus due 
         to reseau removal

     *   on VGISS_5106, the C1559058* cleaned image (and those 
         subsequently processed)  intensify the corrupted lines at the 
         top of the image, replace good pixels with edge effects in the 
         lower left of the image, and remove the moon (or possible Death 
         Star) in the lower right of the image.

      These flaws are not too surprising, given the difficulty involved in 
      this type of systematic processing, and as long as the raw image 
      is preserved, the information isn't lost.  However, a warning to 
      the user about this should be included somewhere on the volume, 
      perhaps  in the processing notes or errata.
