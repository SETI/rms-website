<h1>VG_2801 Peer Review Summary</h1>
Voyager PPS Ring Occultation Data Set<br>
Mark Showalter<br>
September 30, 2003<br>

<p>
This data set has just been delivered to the Central Node for 
final ingestion into the PDS. Thank you very much to the hardy 
souls who submitted peer reviews.

The final version is on line as an expanded directory tree
<a href="/cds/VG_2801/">VG_2801</a> or as a single, downloadable zip file
<a href="/zips/VG_2801.zip">VG_2801.zip</a> (75 Mbytes).

<h2>Overview of Changes</h2>

The most extensive set of changes since the peer review release
have been as follows:
<p>
In support of a user's request, we created a new
VECTORS directory. It contains tables of positional information about
the ring intercept point and the spacecraft position as a function
of time during each occultation experiment.  The vectors are
provided in several useful coordinate frames:
<ul>
<li> Celestial coordinates (B1950 and J2000).
<li> Planet equator coordinates (Z along the planet's rotation pole;
longitudes measured from the equator plane's ascending node on Earth's
equator of B1950 and J2000).
<li> Ring plane coordinates for the rings of Uranus (Z along the ring's
normal, longitudes matching the planet equator coordinates).
<li> Ring anomaly coordinates for the rings of Uranus (Z along the
ring's normal, longitudes measured from the ring's pericenter.
</ul>
These files can be used to generate geometric information not otherwise
found in the geometry footprint models provided earlier. For example, it
becomes easy to figure out the true anomaly of the ring intercept point on
an eccentric/inclined ring.
<p>
Software tools have been cleaned up and better documented, so that users
can build them more easily.
In addition, we have provided some very simple FORTRAN and C programs in
the SOFTWARE directory for reading data records from the binary EDITDATA files.
<p>
Labels have been extensively rewritten to contain more information and to
show greater consistency from directory to directory.
The labels are also now much more consistent across all three Voyager ring
occultation data sets: PPS, UVS and RSS.
<p>
Additional changes reflect issues that have come up more recently in the
Central Node's pre-peer review of the UVS and RSS data sets. Although
these issues were not raised in the Central Node's PPS review (from the
distant past), they are clearly issues that should be addressed now.
<ul>
<li>PRODUCT_IDs have been added to all labels. In addition, SOURCE_PRODUCT_IDs
now provide the connection between each product and the products that were used
in its creation.
<li>ITEM_BYTES had been added to all columns that have multiple items.
<li>CATALOG/TARGET.CAT now provides the missing target information for
Neptune's small inner satellites. This came up because these moons are listed
as targets of the Voyager Neptune SPICE kernel, archived on the
volume.
<li>ASCII format table files have been converted from STREAM to FIXED_LENGTH
format.
<li>Embedded underscores have been removed from all *NAME keywords except
column NAMEs and SAMPLING_PARAMETER_NAMEs.  These exceptions are needed to
support Rings Node software tools.  The minor deviation from PDS standards
has been noted in ERRATA.TXT.
</ul>
