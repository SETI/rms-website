According to the PDS Data Dictionary, thedefinition of ORIGINAL_PRODUCT_ID seems to mean something a little bitdifferent.>>  PPS Team members "as of 1986" -- are these their addresses as of>  1986?

But others (at JPL, the easiest to>  check) seem to be OK.I have added an explanatory note that we have updated contactinformation.>>  Is there a generic Rings Node address/person where reports of errors>  or difficulties could be sent?

I added Mitch Gordon and theRings Node URL is also included.  That's about as much information aswe can realistically provide.>>>CALIB/PN1C01A.TAB>----------------->>  PN1C01A.TAB:  I'm a little out of my element here, but ...  I'm not>  sure what to make of a stellar-background correlation of -1 when all>  of the input values are constant.>>  PN1CO2.TAB:  Similar comment here, though only the stellar signal is>  now fixed.

Thecorrelation parameter is useful to include because it can enter intoestimates of the systematic uncertainty in derived optical depths. Thefact that the estimates are constant (i.e., independent of time) isnot relevant to their uncertainties or correlations.I have revised the DESCRIPTION field of this column to explain whycorrelation values near -1 arise so often.>>CATALOG/DATASET.CAT>------------------->>  line 62: continues --> continuousFixed.>>  line 279: You will want to update the review status.Done.>>  I like the way you have divided the data by levels of processing.>  The short (e.g., 3-6 line) descriptions of each are just about the>  right length.  Descriptions of ancillary data are equally terse yet>  meaningful.>>>CATALOG/SOFTWARE.CAT>====================>>  My recollection is that keyword values should be in upper case>  except for DESCRIPTION and NOTE.  Hence, the SOFTWARE_NAME values>  that are in mixed case should be promoted to upper case.  I'm going>  to be inconsistent by not raising objections to mixed case in>  ON_LINE_IDENTIFICATION -- which probably don't meet the>  recommendation that *.CAT files be limited to 72 character line>  lengths either.>I fixed the SOFTWARE_NAMEs and (against my better judgment) line wrapped theURL and converted it to upper case; with these changes, of course, it willnot work (but the Central Node insisted).I left in a comment indicating the correct, case-sensitive URL.>>CATALOG/INSTHOST.CAT>====================>>  I have a VG2 file dated 2000-07-26 which may be more recent than>  yours.>We have replaced the INSTHOST.CAT file with your version.>>SOFTWARE/PROFILE/AAREADME.TXT>=============================>>  line 14:   indendent --> independent>  line 42:   include --> includes>  line 111:  as in --> as anAll fixed.>>  lines 53-54: I don't understand.
