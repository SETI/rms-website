And I didn'tfind much.  There's the question of PRODUCT_ID, where I believe youhave substituted RING_OBSERVATION_ID to have an equivalent role.  Next time perhaps I won't lose my original set of comments.DickVOLDESC.CAT-----------  Would it be better to have VOLUME_SET_ID =  USA_NASA_PDS_VG_2801_TO_2803 ? More generally, I was slightly  confused by the relationships among data sets, the data set  collection, volumes, and volume sets.  Each data set is on a  separate volume; the data set collection is the same as the volume  set.  There's nothing wrong here -- in fact, everything seems to be  correct; I'm just not used to seeing all these relationships spelled  out.  With regard to VOLUME_SET_ID, if there's no expectation of  adding more volumes, using the explicit range rather than "XX" could  be helpful.AAREADME.TXT------------  Use of DESCRIPTION to show original file name: could also use  ORIGINAL_PRODUCT_ID.  PPS Team members "as of 1986" -- are these their addresses as of  1986? Not sure what this means.  Linda Spilker was not a Spilker in  1986, and her MS today is different from that shown; Brad Wallis  also has a different M/S today.  But others (at JPL, the easiest to  check) seem to be OK.  Is there a generic Rings Node address/person where reports of errors  or difficulties could be sent?  Showalter may not be as active in  RINGS by the time this CD reaches local stores as he is now.CALIB/PN1C01A.TAB-----------------  PN1C01A.TAB:  I'm a little out of my element here, but ...  I'm not  sure what to make of a stellar-background correlation of -1 when all  of the input values are constant.  PN1CO2.TAB:  Similar comment here, though only the stellar signal is  now fixed.  But what is the point in correlating a quantity defined  to have a fixed value with something else?   And what does it mean  when that correlation turns out to be -1?  Other calibration files have similarly large negative correlations  when the input values are either fixed or vary almost none.CATALOG/DATASET.CAT-------------------  line 62: continues --> continuous  line 279: You will want to update the review status.  I like the way you have divided the data by levels of processing.  The short (e.g., 3-6 line) descriptions of each are just about the  right length.  Descriptions of ancillary data are equally terse yet  meaningful.CATALOG/SOFTWARE.CAT====================  My recollection is that keyword values should be in upper case  except for DESCRIPTION and NOTE.  Hence, the SOFTWARE_NAME values  that are in mixed case should be promoted to upper case.  I'm going  to be inconsistent by not raising objections to mixed case in  ON_LINE_IDENTIFICATION -- which probably don't meet the  recommendation that *.CAT files be limited to 72 character line  lengths either.CATALOG/INSTHOST.CAT====================  I have a VG2 file dated 2000-07-26 which may be more recent than  yours.SOFTWARE/PROFILE/AAREADME.TXT=============================  line 14:   indendent --> independent  line 42:   include --> includes  line 111:  as in --> as an  lines 53-54: I don't understand.  What does packaging the software  with a given data set have to do with its list of enhanced features?   And what does that have to do with the contents of  SOFTWARE/PROFILE?  Perhaps these two lines could be omitted?
