The text in thisfile first introduces the user to the the PPS archive, it providesthe volume format, it gives information for the data file formats,and shows the organization of the data on the CD in a useful treestructure.***********************************Directory CALIB/***********************************CALINFO.TXT Comments--------------------->A set of conventions are used for all PPS calibration file names.I like very much this labelling format.>Since multiple solutions have been used in the past (and may be>used in the future), this convention permits more than one>calibration to be providedI think is a very nice way for flexibility to be built into presentand future sets of calibration data.==============================================================PS1 (Saturn) Calibration files==============================================================A comment. I have a table, Notebook #4, pg. 127,  in Lonne'shandwriting, that shows star calibrations from 1981: He lists analpha Lyr, an alpha Cma, and an alpha Leo star calibration on Day306 (1981). I can tell you the FDS times. It looks like ALPHA_LYR,ALPHA_CMA and ALPHA_LEO were not recovered for this 1981, Day 306?(this question is more to Karen Simmons and Lonne Lane, since Inever had these in my hand, or used it.)More comments about the Saturn Calibration files in theDirectory RAW section.PS1CO1.TAB   (LWE calibration curve data)-------------------------------------Looking at the numbers, checking from notes in my "Notebook #3September 1983. From 23 Sept 1983 Memo by LWE regarding the PPS calibration:*64,689-79,300 km, PROCCS 132-354bkg = 8.73+15.567*exp(-8.528E-3*(PROCCS-132))*79,300-120,200 km, PROCCS 355-994bkg=11.71-1.807E-3*PROCCS*120,200-142,200 km, PROCCS 995-1388bkg=24.48-1.466E-2*PROCCSChecking some numbers:REC   Data     Star      Background  150, 52.80193, 39.00000, 13.80193,  0.42426,  0.30000,  0.30000,  0.00000                           ^^^^^^^^bkg =  22.0818  <----Is the PROCCS record number the same? This bkg looks like PROCCS record ~30,instead of record 150.  400, 49.78211, 39.00000, 10.78211,  0.42426,  0.30000,  0.30000,  0.00000                           ^^^^^^^^bkg =  10.9872  <----Is the PROCCS record number the same? This bkg looks like PROCCS record ~285,instead of record 400.1000, 47.15609, 39.00000,  8.15609,  0.42426,  0.30000,  0.30000,  0.00000                            ^^^^^^^^bkg = 9.82000  <----Is the PROCCS record number the same? This bkg looks like PROCCS record ~885,instead of record 1000.The PROCCS record number differ by ~115 records between what I thinkthey are, based on my notebook notes, and what the backgroundnumbers are in this file.I recall that there was introduced in later 1980s a differencebetween the "JPL PROCCS" record numbers and the "LASP PROCCS" recordnumbers because of bad data thrown away (?). My LWE memo abovereferred to the JPL PROCCS numbers, and my notebooks all use that asmy reference point in the PPS Saturn data. I assume that youreceived these data from Karen Simmons (LASP)? Karen most likelyincorporated the 'standard' LWE background number to a file and thenthe records changed when bad data got thrown away, but thebackground values stayed the same, so it's probably OK. Checkingthis with a region we know well.Checking background using the Encke Gap-----------------------------------------Encke Gap. I have: (Notebook #4, pg. 55)PROCCS 1219, pt ~300 to PROCCS 1225, ~pt. 120133426.4 km to 133748.6 km  (LWE ranges)PROCCS 1222 has total signal value of 45.5.(Eccentric ring is PROCCS 1219, pt. 260-295.)The file that should contain the background information isPS1C01.TAB. Since I must first start with a known range, I can usethe PS1GO1.TAB file to extract the (first LWE) range information,and from the range, get the new PROCCS record. From the PROCCSrecord, I can use PS1C01.TAB, in order to extract the background.File PS1G01 gives:1105,133402.75654,"44003:24:701"therefore my PROCCS 1219 = new PROCCS 1105File PS1C01.TAB gives:record   total    star     background1100, 45.69009, 39.00000,  6.69009,  0.42426,  0.30000,  0.30000,  0.000001110, 45.54349, 39.00000,  6.54349,  0.42426,  0.30000,  0.30000,  0.00000So background = ~6.6.Now checking with the old LWE formulabkg=24.48-1.466E-2*PROCCSbkg=24.48-1.466E-2*(1219)bkg = 6.60946OK.PS2C01    (GS-3 mode background data)----------------------------------PS1CO2.TAB561 lines, number of points is right.Checking Values.Let:PROCCS = 1636 the beginning record of the GS3 data.scale = 53.2 = 40*1.33 = the scale for the counts timingEmpirical equation from my Notebook#4, Page #130totalsignal =-8.88213E-4*(index()+PROCCS)*scale +5.7299*scale + 39.0*scaleThe values for column 2: "Total Signal" match.------------------------------>PS2C01.FOR>This file was generated by>running program DOCUMENT/CALIB/PS2C01.FOR based on source file>SORCDATA/OCGS40.DAT provided by Amara Graps.Nice. Thank you for archiving this file (OCGS40.DAT). The rest ofthe cardoard box with my Voyager 9-track tapes was chewed bytermites. You saved it, in time. My notebooks survived, but with acouple of termite holes.------------------------------>PS2R01.FOR>This program generates file RAWDATA/PS2R01.DAT in our standard raw>data file format, from Amara Graps' file SORCDATA/OCGS40.DAT.  It>contains the only known copy of GS-3 mode data that followed>immediately after the PPS ring occultation experiment at Saturn.I had no idea that no one else had a copy of that data!When Karen Simmons dug it up for us, Lonne and I considered it partof the rest of the PPS Saturn stellar occultation. I'm very gladthat you make this point, because some people might miss that thisdata was extremely close in time to the 'regular' PPS occultation,so close, in fact, that we treated it as part of the wholeoccultation.>The source file contains no time tags.  However, the first 1635>samples in the source file are OC-1 points from file>RAWDATA/PS1R01.DAT, resampled to match the integration time of the>GS-3 mode.  By matching up the two data sets, we have been able to>reconstruct the GS-3 time tags unambiguously.Nice work, Mark!------------------------------>PS2R01B.FOR>This task is necessary because it enables us to reconstruct the timing of>some true GS-3 mode data recorded nowhere else but in Amara Graps'>file. [...]>By the fact that the values in the two files>match, we have been able to reconstruct the timing of the GS-3 mode>data.This makes me proud and glad (especially since I tow(ed) thosetapes, notebooks and boxes around with me for more than 15 years!),Thank you.==============================================================PU1 (Uranus sigma Sgr), PU2 (Uranus beta Per) Calibration files==============================================================Files:  PU1C01*   PU2C01*   PU1C02*   PU2C02*---------------------------------------------I can read the data.Files:>PU1C03E*  These particular files are based on the analysis of>PU2C03E*  the Epsilon Ring by Graps et al.

But only the last 2800 points are good(Lonne says because of instrument warmup (Notebook #5, pgs. 183).You could also add that one could test correlations between limitcycle data with the star calibration data using these files, inorder to note how the star was wandering in the PPS FOV (I did thisfor [GRAPS&LANE1986], and found no correlations).>2.9 P21120.SCO>This particular file contains the data from a delta Sco star>calibration experiment carried out in GS-3 mode in May 1985, almost>four years after the Saturn ring occultation experiment.  This file>was provided by Amara Graps and serves as the source file for>RAWDATA/PS8R01.DAT.You could add that this file looks like it has a limit cycle problemembedded in the data. It is probably OK to use for statistical testsif the sample sizes are small. The last 2000 points are the best.>2.17 PESCO.DAT>This particular file contains raw star calibration data obtained by>viewing delta Sco in OC-1 mode about two months after the Voyager 2>encounter with Saturn.

It>was provided by Amara Graps and serves as the source file for>RAWDATA/PS6R01.DAT.Would it be worthwhile giving more details: (20 minutes, 199 PROCCSrecords, last record has bad values) ?I would add that this was also the star calibration file used by[GRAPSETAL1984, Table 1, item (4)], and was generally the most (or_my_ most) frequently-used star calibration file for the Saturn PPSring occultation dataset.>2.19 S3092350.DAT>This particular file contains raw star calibration data obtained by>viewing delta Sco in GS-3 mode about two months after the Voyager 2>encounter with Saturn.

It was>provided by Amara Graps and serves as the source file for>RAWDATA/PS7R01.DAT.You could add that, since this  (9.6 min) dataset was acquiredimmediately after PESCO.DAT (above), when you joined them (binningproperly), it provided a means to test how the PPS behaved whengoing between OC-1 mode and GS-3 mode. I had this concept in mindwhen testing the PPS stellar occultation data between OC-1 and theextra GS-3 mode.In this data, the first half is higher by 13 counts than the secondhalf. (Notebook #4, pg. 149.)I don't know the reason why.>2.20 SCO153.DAT>This particular file contains raw star calibration data obtained by>viewing delta Sco in GS-3 mode about 2.5 months before the Voyager 2>encounter with Saturn.

Because thereis very little mention on the PPS CD about this, mainly you say thatit is a file I used and you don't have very much information aboutit.So then here is all I've extracted from my notebooks regardingthe PROCCS.FOT, PROCCSS1.FOT files.PROCCS.FOTA large array of limit cycle data: PROCCS 1236 -- PROCCS 1380-------Notes--------------------------------------------------Karen first gave me a smaller set from the A-F Ring region.Graps Notebook  #3 Pg. #126-127From: SimmonsTo: Lane, GrapsSub: Limit cycle infor for the A-F ring PROCCS data6 Mar 1984, 21:18"As per your request, I have taken a crack at the limit cycle for theA-F ring area. I used the 12s footprint and extracted the RA/DECinfo for theperiod from 44003:27 thru 44003:45. I put it into a fileon my account called PROCCS.FOT. It has FLTARR(76) arrays where(0) = RA (1) = Dec, (2) = FDS (44003) and (3) = FDS (27)As a 1st crack I overplotted the RA and Dec and a 'limit cycle' isobvious. The good news is these values fall within a 0.1 degreearea.... presumably we should be pretty good in that like of area.Sigh, I guess I should get out the 1. FOV map of data ... sigh. Whewthat was easy (filing system still works!) The full width half maxvalue for the 1. FOV was 0.8 deg. The sides are quite sharp, if weare inside a 0.1 deg area AND that area is boresighted we should bein good shape. (This also assumes the 0.1 deg maps into an Az/Elarea the same size.)Anyway this should give you something to 'play' with! I'llaccumulate the full set ASAP and let you know.P.S. As referenced in another memo today, the RA and Dec come fromthe Footprint product and therefore contain the "boresight offset"as added by the JPL Nav team. The current values refer to the 1/10thFOV boresight."---------------------------------------------------------------------Graps Notebook #3 Pg. 139From: SimmonsTo: Lane, GrapsSub: Amara/FDS Counts12 Apr 1984"Anyway the first part IS wrong. We had four times with the same'FDS MOD60s's to apply FDS line numbers to; each line numberincrement was 200 (not 250 and not .250). Ten lin numbers = .6s.Therefore, each time the FDS MOD60 turns over it is 48s later (in45555:59:001 the '59' is the MOD60 value.) FDS line numbers run from0 to 799. Try that." [...]"Oops, just caught up with some more! You were prob. using .250 forthe SPACING of the points. That would be correct; each of the fourpoints fits equally into the time period. The problem is theassignment of the time period. As I pointed out earlier, eachFDSMOD60 is 48s so each of the four Ra/Dec pairs is 12s each. That'swhere the error is."---------------------------------------------------------------------del-Sco position from Jay: 4/6/84RA: 239.23208Dec: -22.48058 (1950.0)corrected for proper motion to observationb) parallaxc) abberation of starlight---------------------------------------------------------------------In file PS1J01.LBL of this CD:>"This table shows pointing direction>of the PPS instrument as a function of time during the Saturn ring>occultation experiment.

Try reading the nextASSOC record and see what you find.2) Linda's question on limit cycle timing: how sure am I of thetime? HA, ha, ha, haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. Does thatanswer it? (Translated means: NOT AT ALL ..... I have NO confidencein the time tags. I have GUESSED that at least the 1st value of the48s Major Frame is within 12s of where it should be. That Geom.timing question is WAY UP in the air right now.)"---------------------------------------------------------------------Somewhere along the line, I received a larger limit cycle dataset fromKaren Simmons, because I note, Graps Notebook #4, pg.  49:"Original file from Karen: [SIMMONS]PROCCS.FOT;3 copied into[LANE.AMARA]PROCCS1.FOT, len: 650, A(0) =RA, A1(1) = Dec, A(2) = FDS"which is the set (PROCCS1.FOT) that Mark has.---------------------------------------------------------------------My notes on that 650 point PROCCS1.FOT set.Graps Notebook #4, pg. 47Graps Notebook #5, pg. 176-7Ring data can be extracted to match FDS lim cycle.: bin at2pts/record, i.e. 300 pt. bins.

Theeight curves correspond to delta Sco star calibration data,unfortunately none of the curves are labelled with which starcalibration dataset. The warmer is the electronics, the lower thePPS counts. Might be why the occultation star counts did not seem tofit the pre-Saturn star calibrations.: they were made while theelectronics was cold, while the occultation was made while theelectronic was warm.----------------------------------In Notebook #5,  Pg. 105:Notes on the Temperatures of the PPS:* Conversion Factor:For every DN higher, increase by .514%For every DN lower, decrease by .514%Normalizes to the stadard temperature of 104Note: PROCCS stellar occultation temperature = 113/114.----------------------------------In Notebook #5,  Pg. 111:Temperature Conversion for star-cal data:colder --> higher countswarmer --> lower countsDN in temperature of the PPS-0.68%/delta_DNDay 309 PPS temperature = 105 for all star calibration on this day.Day 153, PPS temperature =115 for star calibration this day
