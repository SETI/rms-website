I have searched forold copies of the sample files but they appear to be lost. For now, Ihave added a note to README.TXT warning users of the missing files,and noting that the programs can be adapted to run with other PDS dataproducts. This problem should be fixed in a future release of theObject Access Library.>>Sorcdata directory: no comments.>>Rawdata directory: no comments.>>Easydata directory: I looked here for easy views of calibration data. >I guess that is in the calib directory, but the datainfo.txt or a>readme in the easydata directory should tell us that.The EASYDATA/DATAINFO.TXT now makes it clear that this directory treecontains only calibrated profiles of the ring.I'm not exactly sure what easy views of calibration data would looklike. The calibration files are already ASCII tables, easily plottedby the interested investigator.  I have added notes to the filesAAREADME.TXT, DOCUMENT/TUTORIAL.TXT, CALIB/CALINFO.TXT, and alsoGEOMETRY/GEOMINFO.TXT to emphasize this point.>>Then, in the calib directory, it doesn't contain all the calibration>files.

I think all of it should be there.The calibration files are treated as actual data for our purposes, andare archived along with the occultation data in the SORCDATA, RAWDATAand EDITDATA directories. I believe this is the appropriate approachbecause it guarantees that files with the same format reside togetherin the same directories; it would be more confusing to users to findfiles with radically different formats mixed together.I have added comments to CALIB/CALINFO.TXT to direct users seeking rawcalibration data to the correct directories.>>Also in the calib directory in calinfo.txt: in Phil's memo, give the>full reference for "Uranus" chapter by French et al.I have updated that reference and also the Neptune chapter reference,Porco et al. 1995.>>At the top level in Aareadme.txt, *.pro should be in the list of>source code files.Done.>>Finally, aside from looking at the easydata I've had a frustratingly>difficult time getting to look at any other data.

Ingeneral, software is rarely included on archive volumes because it hassuch a short usable lifetime relative to the data.  Also, it is clearthat the IDL implementation of OAL has not been well maintained.A new set of programs has been added to the SOFTWARE directory:DUMPOC1.FOR, DUMPOC1.C, DUMPGS3.FOR, DUMPGS3.C.  They are C andFORTRAN versions of simple programs to extract records from theEDITDATA binary files.  My hope is that they will solve the problemyou and others have had reading the binary data files. (Sorry but Idon't know how to write IDL versions.)I have also tried to make a few changes to enhance the usability ofthe software included.  The main change is an added file,SOFTWARE/OAL/AAREADME.TXT) to guide users through the building of theC libraries. This is the only step that is necessary for users tobuild the PPS resampling and filtering programs, which are the onlysupported programs on this archive. I have also modified the ProfileLibrary to make it easier to build.Beyond that, I will relay to the Central Node your comments regardingthe IDL interface to the Object Access Library, and regarding thequality of the documentation.>>From an archiving standpoint, it seems to be complete and everything>connected with the data is apparently very well documented.

There's not much I can do about the CTRL-Mproblem, it is a fact of life when moving files between modernhardware.SOFTWARE/OAL/AAREADME.TXT now provides a very brief description of howto build the Object Access Library. Also, the build instructions inSOFTWARE/PROFILE/AAREADME.TXT have been clarified. Also,SOFTWARE/SOFTINFO.TXT now directs the user to both of these filesAAREADME files.In addition, as noted above, much simpler sample programs are now alsoprovided in the SOFTWARE directory.>>Josh
