Since I have this material, and I'vetransported it with me these last 20 years, and the information isunique, I was compelled to use it.  Well and good, but unfortunatelythe time to evaluate took longer than I thought, which I didn't knowuntil I got into it, and began checking files (discovering that alarge number of star calibrations were from me). I needed about aweek to do this evaluation properly, and so now this is the result.---------------------------------------------------------------------QuestionMark, in December 1999, I wrote you notes regarding the Saturn starcalibration data files, and I said in my letter that I would xeroxpages from my notebooks for you. Did I do that? If not, do you stillwant it? I marked those (~20) pages, in the last week.For Near FutureIf you have questions or you need more information, which  I havewith me in my notebooks, I suggest asking before October 2002,because I will moving (Heidelberg->Rome) in November/December, andfor some months my notebooks will be in storage and might not beaccessible.---------------------------------------------------------------------I have organized this evaluation in the following way, with the mostemphasis on the data contents.Evaluation of:* Data Contents                     * details in separate attachment* Ease of Use* Given Tutorial (DOCUMENT/TUTORIAL.TXT)* Working through a past example     * details in separate attachment=======================================================================Evaluation of:-------------------------------------------------------------------* Data Contents-------------------------------------------------------------------Details are provided in the accompanying file:'DetailedEvaluation.txt'SUMMARY:I think that the data on this disk is very well-organized, thedirectory structure is logical and I like the file naming conventionbecause it is sensible and flexible. The data files which wereformatted ASCII were easy to examine, extract and manipulate, howeverthe binary formatted files proved to be a problem for me. I am notfamiliar with OAL, and I don't know if this is the normal way toextract files such as those binary files. If it is, then I am behindthe times, and I should get up to speed on this approach. Instead, myattempt to read  and extract some binary data was with an edited (forUnix) version of one of the supplementary programs provided in the'Processing Software' portion of this disk, and, unfortunately, theread failed, and I don't know why.The labels for each of the data files was easy to understand, the'Contents' file for each directory was useful, important (thank you)and also easy to understand. All of the processing steps illustratingthe procedure from raw to 'final' product was clear.In several places where I could check the values of the data, I did. Ifound one discrepancy with the background values of the PS1CO1.TABfile. Since I thought the discrepancy might be due to differencesbetween JPL and LASP in their PROCCS record numbering, to check that,I looked at a familiar region, the Encke Gap, in order to see if thebackground that you have stored is the proper one. It looked OK. Imight be useful to mention somewhere that the PROCCS numbering changed? (for viewers like me who used the old JPL numbering)I was very happy to see my favorite Saturn GS-3 mode stellaroccultation (that part at the end of the main OC-1 mode) become partof the standard data archive. I didn't know that I was the only ownerof that data, and seeing it described on this disk in the way that itwas, was a pleasant surprise.I was disappointed to not see the any of the Saturn PPS 0.1 km 0.2 km0.5 km resolution in ASCII form stored, even though I understand thatthese files could be very large, and it is likely expect the casualuser of EASYDATA would not be interested in these high resolutionfiles.I am not sure that the given geometry (range) information is accurateenough, since we  we are given one range per record, and mustinterpolate between the 600 points in a record.I didn't see several 1981 star calibration files (that I thoughtexisted) for the stars alpha Lyr, an alpha Cma, and an alpha Leo.I have provided more information if that would be useful. I have givenmore information for some files in the RAWDATA directory. Inappendices to 'DetailedEvaluation, I have given Uranus PPS inferredPPS background and star values (publ in Graps et al., 1995), UranusPPS published calibration and equivalent depths (to compare withabove), more limit cycle information, a LWE memo of background atUranus due to off-axis light, and notes for delta Sco star calibrationraw counts as a function of electronics temperature.-------------------------------------------------------------------* Ease of Use-------------------------------------------------------------------SUMMARY: The binary data extraction was a problem for me, otherwise Igive the highest marks for ease of use of this CD.* Given Tutorial (DOCUMENT/TUTORIAL.TXT)SUMMARY: I thought that this file would be an example "walk-through"to extract data, and it isn't. However, it is the most important fileafter 'AAREADME.TXT', and gives the most important information that Ithink a user needs.-------------------------------------------------------------------* Working through a past example-------------------------------------------------------------------Uranus ring data extraction and manipulationTask: Extract three cuts of the Epsilon ring, and compute theeccentricity of the outer edge of the ring using radiuses andlongitudes. (roughly)Answer:  eccentricity = 9.7 E-03(Uranus Notebook #1,pg. 26 = eccentricity = 8.24622E-03,Elliot&Nicholson, _Planetary Rings_ = 7.94E-03)So then, same magnitude as 'right answer', but off, due to onlyworking with very few significant digits, and lower resolution of thecuts used here, especially BPI. This can be improved using closer-tothe highest resolution data.---------------------------------------------------------------------Giving subjective evaluation numbers, from scale of 1 to 10:* Data Contents  9.5 (weighted most)* Ease of Use  9.0* Given Tutorial (DOCUMENT/TUTORIAL.TXT) 7.0* Working through a past example    9.0 --> Very GoodAmara Graps-- ************************************************************************Amara Graps, PhD             | Max-Planck-Institut fuer KernphysikHeidelberg Cosmic Dust Group | Saupfercheckweg 1+49-6221-516-543             | 69117 Heidelberg, GERMANYAmara.Graps@mpi-hd.mpg.de    * http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/dustgroup/~graps************************************************************************I'M SIGNIFICANT!...screamed the dust speck. -- CalvinAttachment converted: Data:WorkingPastEx.txt (TEXT/R*ch) (00044250)Attachment converted: Data:DetailedEvaluation.txt (TEXT/R*ch) (00044251)
