If additional files turnup at some point, we can archive them in a supplemental data set (or anew version of this one). However, it seems unlikely to me that anyunique, critical information has been lost due to missing starcalibrations.>>More comments about the Saturn Calibration files in the>Directory RAW section.>>PS1CO1.TAB   (LWE calibration curve data)>------------------------------------->>Looking at the numbers, checking from notes in my "Notebook #3>September 1983.>> From 23 Sept 1983 Memo by LWE regarding the PPS calibration:>>*64,689-79,300 km, PROCCS 132-354>bkg = 8.73+15.567*exp(-8.528E-3*(PROCCS-132))>>*79,300-120,200 km, PROCCS 355-994>bkg=11.71-1.807E-3*PROCCS>>*120,200-142,200 km, PROCCS 995-1388>bkg=24.48-1.466E-2*PROCCS>>Checking some numbers:>REC   Data     Star      Background>  150, 52.80193, 39.00000, 13.80193,  0.42426,  0.30000,  0.30000,  0.00000>                           ^^^^^^^^>bkg =  22.0818  <---->Is the PROCCS record number the same?

Checking>this with a region we know well.The discrepancy arises from the fact that we have thrown away 114records from the beginning of the file EDITDATA/PS1D01.DAT. This isdocumented in the label of that file.The label for the calibration file CALIB/PS1C01.TAB refers to theprogram used to create it, DOCUMENT/CALIB/PS1C01.FOR. This programshows how the background calibration was derived. It also shows how toconvert between new record numbers and old PROCCS record numbers.I apologize for the confusion, which will only arise for users of theold data trying to use the new PDS archive.I have added a brief "Note to prior users of the PPS data" toTUTORIAL.TXT, and also a warning in EDITDATA/DATAINFO.TXT that recordnumbers have changed. I hope that this, combined with the pointers inthe file labels, will be sufficient.As you noted below, when the same region of the rings is identified inboth data sets, the background values are found to agree. So this doesnot indicate a problem with the calibration files, just confusion overrecord numbers.>>Checking background using the Encke Gap>----------------------------------------->>Encke Gap.
