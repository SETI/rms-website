<h1>Raw Radio Science Data from the Voyager 2 Radio Occultation at Uranus, collected at Canberra Observatory</h1>
Review facilitated by the Ring-Moon Systems Node of NASA PDS: Mia Mace, Matt Tiscareno.<br>
May, 2025
</br>
The data provider is Richard A. Simpson.
</br>
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>This bundle contains open-loop radio science raw data collected using
NASA Deep Space Network antennas near Canberra, Australia, on
January 24-25, 1986.  The 64-m antenna (DSS-43) and the 34-m antenna
(DSS-42) both received S-Band (13.1 cm wavelength) and X-band (3.6 cm
wavelength) transmissions in right circular polarization from Voyager 2
during its encounter with Uranus (and its satellite Miranda).</p>

<p>The data include samples from all four receivers during the flyby of
Miranda and during the occultations by the Uranian rings, ionosphere,
and neutral atmosphere.  Also included are calibration measurements
collected a few hours prior to the Miranda and Uranus observations.</p>

<p>55 original binary data tapes -- known as Original Data Records (ODRs)
-- were delivered to the Voyager Radio Science Team in a format
specified by the DSN RSC-11-9 Software Interface Specification (SIS)
(version dated 1 March 1985).</p>

<p>Each original ODR tape forms the basis for a PDS4 product in the bundle.
The binary file is the first part of the product; but the binary data
are in an archaic binary format, so they have been converted to ASCII
tables for easier reading.  In addition there is one ASCII table with
record header data and a separate ASCII file with header labels for the
ASCII record header data.  Together, they can be used to create a
spreadsheet with record header data.</p>

<p>There is a separate ASCII table/file for samples from each receiver --
43SR, 42SR, 43XR, and 42XR. Future users will likely prefer to work with
the ASCII files rather than the original binary file.  Each product also
includes a detached PDS4 label file written in XML.  For example, the
following eight files constitute one PDS4 product (from original tape
UC0475):</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;  vg2u_40mr_1986025t001902.dat  –   original ODR file (Unisys binary)</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  vg2u_40mr_1986024t001902.hdr  –   record header data (ASCII)</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  vg2u_40mr_1986024t001902.txt  –   field headers for the hdr file (ASCII)</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  vg2u_40mr_1986024t001902.xml  –   PDS4 XML label (ASCII)</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  vg2u_42sr_1986024t001902.tab  –   DSS-42 S-band receiver samples (ASCII)</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  vg2u_42xr_1986024t001902.tab  –   DSS-42 X-band receiver samples (ASCII)</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  vg2u_43sr_1986024t001902.tab  –   DSS-43 S-band receiver samples (ASCII)</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;  vg2u_43xr_1986024t001902.tab  –   DSS-43 X-band receiver samples (ASCII)</br>

<p>Each *.tab file has been processed to give a 'browse' product -- a figure
in JPEG format providing a snapshot of tape content and data quality.
Each figure contains a histogram of data sample values, a line drawing of
average sample power versus time, a waterfall plot of time-averaged power
spectra, and labeling information.</p>

<h3>Instructions for Reviewers</h3>
<p>
Here are guidelines and some information to help you produce an effective review with a reasonable level of effort.
</p>

All reviewers must address two general areas:
<ul>
<li> Scientific merit of data (are these the proper data to be archived?),
<li> Usability of the data (appropriate formats; completeness of data set, including ancillary data; comprehensive documentation).
</ul>

Furthermore, if you are one of the panel members with a direct affiliation with the PDS, please also address a third general area:
<ul>
<li> Compliance with PDS4 Standards.
</ul>
If you are <b>not</b> one of the panel members with a direct affiliation with the PDS, then you do <b>not</b> need to address compliance with PDS4 standards. Rather, you should focus on the data (including ancillary data) and documentation.
<p>
While it is not realistic for you to analyze every data file, please check enough to convince yourself of the quality and consistency of the data and of any errors that you encounter.
</p>
<p>
Please also evaluate the documentation provided in individual table labels, and referenced journal articles. Much of the information contained in the referenced articles is not duplicated in the data sets.
</p>
<p>
Questions for reviewers to address are:
<ul>
<li> Documentation:
<ul>
<li> Does the documentation explain the data and how they were produced?
<li> Does the documentation explain how to use the data?
<li> Is the documentation (including referenced journal articles) sufficient to ensure the data will be intelligible to a scientist 10, 20, or 50 years in the future?
</ul>
<li> Data:
<ul>
<li> Are you able to manipulate and plot the data, interpret columns into tables, and understand the context and relationships of the data products?
<li> Are there any concerns about the creation/generation, calibration (if appropriate), or general usability of the data? 
<li> Is the archive design suitable (is the directory tree structured in a reasonable way)?
</ul>
</ul>
The review panel submits written reviews by email and then, if the RMS Node thinks it is necessary, participates in a teleconference (date TBD) to discuss the reviews, including strengths and weaknesses of the data set. Specific shortcomings and errors will be identified as "liens" &ndash; questions about or requests for change &ndash;  which will need to be corrected. The review panel is responsible for making a recommendation on whether:
<ul>
<li> The bundle/s passed peer review and can be archived, once a set of panel identified liens have been resolved.
<li> The material did not pass peer review, and must undergo an incremental (delta) review in certain specified areas.
<li> The material did not pass peer review, and must undergo another full peer review.
<li> The material did not pass peer review, and does not merit a second peer review.
</ul>

<p>
In addition to an overall recommendation, the RMS Node will compile a list of liens in the archive design or sample products/bundle. The liens must be resolved before the associated data set can be archived.
</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; 10           warning.label.context_ref_mismatch    <br/>
</code>

<ul>
<li><b>10 <code>warning.label.context_ref_mismatch</b></code></br>
Four of these refer to Voyager 1 being described as 'Equipment' rather than 'Spacecraft'. This is because Voyager 1 is the 'target' of spacecraft engineering 'observations'. That is, the onboard engineering system is monitoring the status of the spacecraft. So, even though Voyager 1 is participating in observations of Saturn, the engineering system doesn't know that; its target is the spacecraft itself.
RMS is submitting an SCR to discuss dual use context products for discussion within DDWG and CCB (in-prep).</br>
Six of these refer to a context product that has a typo (a new version has been submitted but not yet posted for 'DSS-42 34-m Radio Telescope').
</li>
<li><b>1 <code>warning.integrity.pds4_version_mismatch</code></b></br>
The Canberra files were developed under IM v1.23.0.0 while the re-used Parkes files (secondary members in calib_freq, document, and geometry collections) were developed under IM v1.21.0.0.
</li>
</ul>

These known issues will be resolved during lien resolution, along with any other issues raised by the reviewers and deemed reasonable/necessary.
