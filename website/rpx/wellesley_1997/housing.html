# Housing for the Wellesley Workshop

<h2 id="wellesley-college-club">Wellesley College Club</h2>

<p>Ten double rooms have been reserved at the Wellesley College Club
(617-283-2700) for the nights of July 24 and July 25. The cost is $65/single,
$80/double. The deadline for reserving a room is July 6.</p>

<p>The Wellesley College Club is located on campus. It is within walking distance
of the town of Wellesley, where you can find restaurants and other amenities.
Maps of the campus are available at the College Club, and the Observatory is a
just a short walk.</p>

<p>As you enter campus, the College Club is about 50 feet ahead on the left. You
can pick up your keys at the desk. If the building is locked when you arrive,
you should follow the posted instructions on the inner door, which direct you
to call campus police. They will open the building for you and get you your
room keys. If you have difficulties upon your arrival, contact Dick French at
617-235-4965 (home), 283-3747 (work).</p>

<p>Housing will also be available on the MIT campus for three days prior to the
DPS Meeting. See the <a href="//web.mit.edu/dps97/">DPS Web page</a> for more
information and for an on-line registration form. Rooms are $48/single,
$66/double per night, all taxes included. The deadline for campus housing
requests is July 14, 1997.</p>

<p>Housing will be in McCormick and Baker Halls, located along the Charles River
and 800 m from the MBTA Red Line at Kendall Square. Guest rooms are non-
airconditioned and are furnished with twin-sized beds, linens, pillows,
blankets, towels, desks, and telephones. Fans are available upon request.
There is one women’s bath and one men’s bath per floor, except in the case of
a designated single gender floor. Rooms are serviced each day (towels
changed); linens are changed weekly.</p>

<p>If you are staying in Cambridge, we recommend that you hook up with someone
who has a car, since that is by far the easiest way to get to the College.</p>
