<h1 id="a-workshop-on-observations">A Workshop on Observations</h1>
<p>of the Saturn System<br />
from the 1995-6 Ring Plane Crossings</p>

<h2 id="july-25--26-1997">July 25 &amp; 26, 1997</h2>
<p>Wellesley College<br />
Wellesley, Massachusetts</p>

<p>The edge-on presentation of Saturn’s rings during 1995 and early 1996 provided
an opportunity to study aspects of the Saturn system rarely observable from
Earth. New results have been reported on the orbits and photometry of the
smallest moons, thickness of the inner ring system and the nature of its
atmosphere, structure of the tenuous outer E and G Rings, and determination of
the rate of precession of Saturn’s pole. One of the biggest puzzles is the
apparent shift of Prometheus in its orbit by 19 degrees. In addition, numerous
observers have reported the discovery of new moons and/or ring clumps. The
recent events probably provided our last chance to study many of these aspects
of the Saturn system prior to the arrival by the Cassini orbiter in 2004. [</p>

<p>The meeting is timed to precede the 1997 <a href="http://web.mit.edu/dps97/">DPS
meeting</a>, to be held at MIT beginning Monday, July
28. <a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/">Wellesley College</a> is located in a pleasant
suburban area about 13 miles west of Cambridge and downtown Boston.</p>

<p>The workshop will be stuctured around a series of ~30 minute contributed
presentations, with plenty of discussion time interspersed. The deadline for
titles and brief abstracts of presentations will coincide with the DPS
abstract deadline, <strong>Wednesday, June 4, 1997</strong>.</p>
