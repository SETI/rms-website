AAREADME.TXT -- Updated 13-dec-1994 by Mark Showalter

This directory and its subdirectories contain the proceedings for the Tucson
workshop on Saturn's ring plane crossing.  Many of the pages are reproduced as
"GIF" files which may or may not be completely legible.  Individuals who wish to
receive a hardcopy of the proceedings should send an email request to Mark
Showalter (showalter@ringside.arc.nasa.gov) or Ken Bollinger
(bollinger@ringside.arc.nasa.gov).

Each individual presentation from the meeting is found in a subdirectory
identified by the speaker's last name.  For those who spoke more than once, the
name is followed by an underscore and then the sequence number of their
presentation.

This directory includes the following files:

CONTENTS.TXT            The table of contents included in the Proceedings
                        packet.  (It is also reproduced below).

PARTICIPANTS.TXT        A list of all participants in the workshop.

COVER.GIF		The cover page/agenda for the workshop.

SATURNICENTRIC.GIF	A plot of the Saturnicentric latitude of the Earth and
			Sun as a function of time during the upcoming ring plane
			crossings.

STRUVE.GIF		The Struve family dynasty.
