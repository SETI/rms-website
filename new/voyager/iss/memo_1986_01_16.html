    From: T. V. Johnson, Arithmatic Society 
    Subject: Corrections to Danielson et al. Calibration 
     
         The current calibration factors used to correct FICOR output 
    to I/F are derived from the Danielson et al. paper.  These 
    factors, and their associated omega0 values qualitatively amount 
    to the assumption that the VGR camera bench calibrations for the 
    Blue filter are correct and that the color of the inflight plaque 
    target is the same as that measured by Rennelson for a piece of 
    similar material.  This correction brought most VGR I/F values 
    for Jupiter targets into resonably good agreement with ground- 
    based data both in absolute albedo at Blue (~4800 A) and in 
    relative spectral reflectance between filters. 
         Subsequent analysis of VGR spectral data and comparisons 
    with ground-based spectral reflectance measurements have shown 
    that the Danielson et al. corrections to bench calibration values 
    do not completely correct VGR values to the best estimates of 
    ground-based spectral albedoes for a number of targets, both at 
    Jupiter and Saturn (see Johnson et al. 1982 for a discussion of 
    Jupiter satellite comparisons).  The attached figure shows 
    several estimates of 'corrected' VGR I/F values divided by 
    ground-based 'truth'.  The square points are an average and 
    standard deviation of VGR data divided by ground-based data from 
    McFadden et al. (appropriately convolved with the NA camera 
    system response), for all four Galilean satellites and for both 
    the Voyager 1 and 2 cameras.  The circled X's are a similar 
    exercise carried out by Bonnie Burratti for several Saturnian 
    satellites compared with values from ground-based photometry by 
    Noland et al.  The other points are individual comparisons I made 
    of Rhea photometry with data from Bell et al.  The ratios are all 
    very consistent and the current estimate of the correction to the 
    Danielson et al. values has been made from the average of the 
    Johnson values for Jupiter and the Burratti estimates for Saturn. 
    Scaled to Blue filter correction = 1.0000 these values are: 
     
    UV - 0.828 
    VI - 0.935 
    BL - 1.000 
    OR - 1.053 
     
         The values of IPL correction factors and the Omega0 values 
    for each planet in the attached table are derived from the above 
    by multiplying the existing omega0's by the above values and 
    dividing the IPL factors by the same. 
     
         We recommend that the the MIPL FIXVGR program replace the 
    existing values for these correction factors with the ones in the 
    table and use them for future I/F processing.
