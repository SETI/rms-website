## Introduction

This tape volume contains IRIS full resolution spectra data and associated
pointing and geometric information for both the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2
Jupiter encounters. Also included in this volume is calibration information
for the IRIS instrument on each spacecraft, PDS catalog information describing
the IRIS instrument and Jupiter data set, and PDS labels and record structure
information for the data set.

## File Format

Most files on this tape have a label encoded in the Object Description
Language (ODL) developed by the Planetary Data System (PDS). An ODL label is
readable by both humans and computers. It provides a formal description of the
format and content of a file. For some files the ODL label appears at the
beginning of the file (as is the case for this file). Binary data files
provided on this tape are described by detached ODL labels. The detached
labels end in a .lbl extension and the associated data file ends in a .dat
extension.

PDS label formats and documentation conform to standards as defined by the
Planetary Data System Standards Reference (JPL D-7669, Part 2, November 1992,
Version 3.0) and the Planetary Science Data Dictionary (JPL D-7116, November
1992, Rev. C) with the following exceptions. Data product labels for the
products were approved prior to the release of the Version 3.0 Standards
Reference, so do not strictly conform to the Data Product Label standard in
Ch. 5 of the PDS Standards Reference, Version 3.0. In particular, the Standard
Formatted Data Unit (SFDU) standard from Chapter 17 of the Planetary Data
System Data Preparation Workbook - Volume 2, Standards, May 3, 1991, Version
2.0 is used.

## On-line Analysis and Ordering Capabilities

Portions of this data set are available on-line through the Planetary
Atmospheres Node Data Analysis (PANDA) system at the PDS Atmospheres node, and
a variety of data analysis services are available. In addition, subsets of
this data set meeting various user-supplied selection criteria are also
available for electronic delivery.
